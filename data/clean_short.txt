The sheriff, having considered all the evidence presented to him, DETERMIN,t occurred has not been unascertained. I cannot exclude the possibility that the fan heater recovered from the locus was in some way implicated. The existence of the other popped cans in the vicinity points to some such connection. However, I am not satisfied that the evidence is such that it would be safe for me to come to any conclusion as to what that connection was. It is, however abundantly clear that no naked flame such as one might expect from a blow torch was involved.   195.    During the course of the Inquiry I expressed my sympathy to the family of the deceased over their sad loss. In concluding this note I wish to pay tribute to the courteous and dignified way the family members conducted themselves during what was for them a difficult, extended and frustrating court procedure.

[100] It was clear from the CCTV evidence and the evidence of those present on the night that some six minutes elapsed between Mr Jamieson's arrival at the charge bar and the commencement of the processing procedure. Sergeant Comrie gave evidence that he was completing paperwork concerning too other prisoners. While such attention to detail is no doubt commendable, it ignores the fact that two officers who were clearly having difficulty supporting Mr Jamieson had to wait standing at the charge bar. That is, of course, a point of practice for the Force to consider but one might be excused for considering that the prisoner and two officers waiting at the charge bar had greater priority.

I am indebted to Miss O'Sullivan for her efficient, thorough and sensitive presentation of the evidence in the public interest.   [316] Finally, I wish to pay tribute to those members of Mr Ewing's family who listened to the evidence during the Inquiry. They conducted themselves with great courage and fortitude in what were harrowing and distressing circumstances. Mr Ewing's death occurred in highly unusual circumstances which arose from a combination of events which are unlikely ever to be repeated. While that may be of some reassurance to the public at large, it will be of little comfort to Mr Ewing's relatives. It remains for me to express my deepest sympathy to Mrs Ann Ewing and her family in relation Gordon Ewing's tragic death.

SUMMERS ESQ.    in the Inquiry under the Fatal Accidents &amp; Sudden Deaths Inquiry ( Scotland ) Act 1976    into the Death of    WALLACE EWEN    ___________________        BANFF, 19th April 2010.     The Sheriff having resumed consideration of the evidence, affidavits, productions and submissions, Determines:-   1. In terms of Section 6(1)(a) of the Fatal Accidents &amp; Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 ("the Act") that Wallace Ewen, who was born on 2,or might not have been a contributing factor in his initially losing control of the vehicle. I make no finding in relation to that. Again, however, on the basis of the evidence I heard, I am satisfied that the amount of alcohol in his body will have significantly impaired Mr Ewen's ability to drive, and in particular will have slowed down his reaction time. I am satisfied that having lost control of the tractor and trailer, the amount of alcohol in his blood is a factor that contributed to his being unable to regain control. In those circumstances and for the purposes of Section 6(1)(e) of the Act, I find that the amount of alcohol he had consumed is a factor that is relevant to the circumstances of Mr Ewen's death. It does not seem to me that there are any other factors that are relevant.

One can envisage that it is not merely in the instant case that problems may arise with any copy made from the hard drive of a computer either because sufficient care has not been taken to secure that the appropriate footage is copied or because of some error in copying or even I suppose, because of a defect in the disc. Certainly my experience of the copying of CCTV footage in criminal cases indicates that not uncommonly the copy is found to be defective in one way or another. Fortunately in the instant matter DC Richards had taken a note of what he had seen.   In the result however my determinations in this inquiry are formal.

In terms of section 6(1) (a) of the Act that Andrew Andrews, who was born on 14 August 1946, died at 14.30 hours on 29 November 2007 at Wishaw Gen,n relation to the training undergone by ambulance drivers. It was not explored in his evidence to what, if any, extent issues such as an ambulance becoming stuck in difficult road conditions are dealt with in that training. Given that ambulances are required at times to work in difficult weather conditions and, as we have seen, to negotiate bad roads, and given the potentially catastrophic results of clutch failure it may be that further consideration could usefully be given to this topic by training providers.   21.  Members of Mr Andrews' family were in attendance throughout the inquiry. I greatly appreciate the concentration, stamina and quiet dignity they maintained throughout often difficult evidence. I wish to convey my personal sympathy to them for the great loss they have suffered.

It is my recommendation that these standards be revisited yet again and that consideration be given to removing the qualification "where the presence of children is anticipated" thus requiring the 100 mm rule to be applied across the board. This would lead to certainty, it would reduce subjectivity. Provision can be made for exceptions to the rule but only if exceptional circumstances exist which would justify such a relaxation . It is now known that had the rule applied when the Princes Exchange was designed this accident would have been prevented.   I make no specific recommendations to relating to the matters raised in Mr Sylvester Evans supplementary note (crown production 107). However I commend the note to interested parties for their consideration .

That governance complies with any recommendation I have made and satisfies any of the criticisms which have arisen as a result of this inquiry.   Mr Greig's death was very unfortunate in the circumstances in which it happened. There is little to suggest that Mr Greig's life would have been saved had there been the appropriate level of intervention at his attendance at hospital. However what is clear is that palliative assistance was denied to him and, correspondingly, his wife had to endure the trauma of his sudden death.   My sympathies are extended to Dr Grieg without whose patience and dogged determination this Inquiry would not have taken place.       Humbly Reported    Sheriff of North Strathclyde .

I have made a determination and recommendation to that effect. [62]  In concluding her submissions Miss Watt, whilst conceding that a cycle helmet would have made no difference to the tragic outcome of this accident, invited the Inquiry to make a finding that it would be reasonable to make a determination that cyclists when training should, as is recommended in the Highway Code, wear a helmet.  [63]  In my opinion common sense dictates that whenever possible cyclists should wear cycle helmets when on public roads. I have so determined and made an appropriate recommendation under Section 6(1)(e) of the Act.

That is in order to prevent a recurrence of such a tragedy. I regret to say that I regard the Crown position, in relation to those central witnesses not led, to have been unhelpful. There remain questions unanswered. It is all the more surprising considering that it took from December 2005 to April 2009 for the Inquiry to commence with the Crown position in relation to witnesses still unresolved.

From this I take that it the RCA was aimed at procedures and processes that are internal to the running of the Infirmary. It had no wider ambit and there was nothing in it that required it to be exhibited to or released to anyone other than those involved in the structural management of the Infirmary. Beyond that she was not asked in examination in chief if she was under any obligation to release to the family a copy of the RCA at any point in time prior to the start of the Inquiry, and she was not cross examined at all. There is therefore no factual basis before the Inquiry for any obligation of the kind suggested by the family. For all these reasons I am unable to make any determination on this concern.

Introduction   May I firstly record my sympathy for the family of Mrs Forrest, who might not have died during her visit to Queen  Margaret  Hospital in late December 20,ully aware of the role of co-ordinators.    (3) Much more training on procedures including risk assessment, observation and documentation should be compulsory.    (4) There should be a means of auditing the participation of nurses in training and appropriate sanctions if there is a failure.    (5) The training of doctors and nurses in areas such as risk assessment, communication, documentation and observation should be more co-ordinated so that the same training is applied across all disciplines.    (6) In more general terms I suggest that any party represented at a Fatal Accident Inquiry should be under a duty to disclose to all other parties and to the court all information relevant to the Inquiry and the identity of all witnesses who might assist the Inquiry in reaching a determination.

He replied in the negative. This tragic case, accordingly, was a very rare case of RSV causing death by the cessation of breathing and an out of hospital cardiac arrest.  While the attention of the court was concentrated principally on the actings of emergency ambulance personnel and medical staff, it is worthy to note that Mrs Satha acted perfectly appropriately not only in her care of Zion before the fatal incident but also afterwards in contacting promptly emergency services and administering CPR as instructed. As stated in open court, I would again express my deepest sympathy to Mr and Mrs Satha and wider family, who attended each day with a new baby.

I see no need to make any recommendation in this regard.   The obligation to look after oneself, when one is capable of doing so, lies with the patient alone. In this case Kirsty chose not to take advice and go to hospital. Even if she had gone to hospital, the Sepsis might have caused irreversible damage. From the evidence may have been suffering for a couple of days or possibly as much as a couple of weeks during which time Sepsis is likely to have taken hold with tragic consequences for her and her family and friends. Mrs Fotheringham attended Court every day and my sincere condolences go out to her and Kirsty's family.     John Craig Cunningham McSherry Dunfermline , 5 th August 2010

I do not consider that I can make determinations in these exact terms because, on the evidence before me, I cannot be satisfied either that such steps are not already in place or that the matter of "cold shock" is not adequately dealt with in existing training courses. But, I have made a qualified finding to "flag up" the points made by the Procurator Fiscal Depute.

The sheriff, having resumed consideration, determines under the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry ( Scotland ) Act 1976 ("the Act") as follows:-   (a)     that in terms of s. 6(1)(a) of the Act, Michael Lindley Scott born 31 May 1988 was pronounced dead at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on 13 December 2006 . The death followed upon an accident wh,al proceedings have been concluded against any person in respect of the death or any accident from which the death resulted, and the Lord Advocate is satisfied that the circumstances of the death have been sufficiently established in the course of such proceedings." Criminal proceedings were taken against the employer, but it was held that there was insufficient evidence in law to allow the case to go to the jury. Before that stage was reached, the Crown must have had available to it all of the necessary evidence to determine where and when the death and the accident relating to the death took place and the cause or causes of the death and any accident resulting in the death. It is not obvious to me that any new information was brought out in the Inquiry which was conducted in front of me.

The fact that neither Dr Mirghani nor Dr Millar had access to those results was a further factor. The failure to complete properly the card requesting the procedure prevented Dr Mirghani and Dr Millar from realizing the true position and further diminished Mrs Wilson's chances. Her own condition, her persistence in smoking which increased the vascular problems she was suffering from as well the natural consequences of the procedure which was essential, namely, potential bleeding into the soft tissues and the dislodgement of emboli were further factors which diminished Mrs Wilson's chances of survival. Sadly, the combination of all these led to her death.

The Sheriff, having considered all the evidence adduced and the submissions made thereon, determines in terms of Se,d addressed.   [33]     Shortly after the death, Mr Gilfillan's father had sought closure to the matter by asking what would have been the likely outcome of the hearing on 28 October 2008 . In a letter from the Chief Executive, dated 6 November, it was stated that the manager who was to chair that hearing had been asked to review the papers. She concluded that there was a case to answer, that the allegations were serious, that it was not an isolated event and that Mr Gilfillan had admitted what he had done. In those circumstances, she concluded that the appropriate sanction would have been a first and final warning, not dismissal. However, she did not give evidence to this inquiry, so how much influence the erroneous concept of fraud had in determining the appropriate sanction, is unknown.

As a result of that change there is now a chronology of the young person set up and maintained. While the matter was not gone into in detail, as I understand it, the chronology is a summary record of the relevant issues of the young person.

The Procurator Fiscal submitted that a finding to that effect in terms of section 6(1)(c) might be made. I agree that that can be characterised as a reasonable precaution, the taking of which might have avoided the accident.   [40] Although it made no difference to the outcome of the accident, so far as Mr. Ramsay was concerned, I think that the fact that he was not wearing his seatbelt is a fact relevant to the circumstances of the death, if only to remind other road-users of the usefulness of doing so in most circumstances.

Cause of death His death was caused by 1(a) Ischaemic Heart Disease (b),e first reasonable precaution which should have been taken. That was to ascertain if Mr. Khalid's chest pain had gone completely. That was, on the medical evidence, the reasonable step for Miss Williams-Martin to have taken when confronted with a previously well patient with known coronary heart disease; and a previous myocardial infarction patient who had suffered a sudden onset of acute chest pain which was unusual for him. I have found that was not done by her. On that basis I find that to have done so was also a reasonable precaution whereby Mr. Khalid's death might have been avoided. [49].    I would stress however that to have done so would not have guaranteed Mr. Khalid's survival. Nor would that survival have been a probability. The evidence does not support either such conclusion.

Mactaggart   2011 FAI 19  Sheriffdom of  North Strathclyde  at Dumbarton     Fatal Accident Inquiry  Under  Fatal Accident and Sudden Deaths Inquiry ( Scotland ) Act 1976    DETERMINATION  By  SHERIFF M S MACTAGGART  Following an Inquiry at  Dumbarton Sheriff Court  into the circumstances of the death of  ROBERT SHREENAN  B548/10    Dumbarton,  18 April 2011   The Sheriff, having resumed consideration of the cause, DETERMINES in terms of section 6 of the Fatal Accident and Sudden Deaths ( Scotland ) Act 1976:-   (a)  In terms of section 6 (1) (a) of said Act that Robert Shreenan (born 9 th January 1960) and ordinarily resident at 11 Apple Close, Blac,till be some circumstances, albeit rare, in which it is deemed appropriate to provide a plastic bag to a prisoner.  I am not satisfied that there should be any determination under this section. There is no need for any recommendation in relation to comfort stops for prisoners nor in relation to the transfer of prescribed medication with prisoners in transit which procedure has now been clarified. Accordingly I do not find it necessary to make any recommendations as a result of this Inquiry.  In conclusion it appears that, tragically, Mr Shreenan was determined to take his own life on 14 July 2008. Every effort was made to save his life at Clydebank Police Office and by emergency services but this proved unsuccessful. The Inquiry would wish to extend its condolences to Mr Shreenan's family.

The Sheriff Principal, having considered all the evidence adduced, Determines:-   1.      In terms of Section 6(1)(a) of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976, that Colin Marr, who was born on 18 January 1984, died on Tuesday 10 July 2007 in his home ,n any way undermining the presumption of innocence which Candice Bonar enjoys.   9. Miscellaneous   9.1    In his closing submission Allen Marr suggested that there were unresolved issues and that I should recommend further investigative work be carried out. I do not see that as part of my function but in any event, in light of the evidence I have heard, I doubt whether there are any other useful lines of investigation which could be pursued and I see no basis for thinking that further investigation would cast any more light on the circumstances of the death.   9.2    It only remains for me to acknowledge and commend the assistance of counsel, solicitors and Mr Marr in the efficient conduct of the inquiry and to again extend my sympathies to the family of Colin Marr at his premature death.

That in respect of subsection (a), Mrs Marion Bellfield (d.o.b 22/3/49 ) died at 22.08 hours on 15 February 2009 at her home at 82 Chapelhil,e advice was given to Mrs Bellfield. I did accept the evidence of Nurse Walker that Mrs Bellfield was handed the report of her procedure along with the standard discharge advice, and the note taken by Dr Smith in particular, although not conclusive, would tend to suggest that he had sight of the former. In any event, the point is in a sense academic given that Mr Bellfield did in fact call NHS 24 to attend to his wife.     [56] Finally, I wish to thank parties' legal representatives for the manner in which the Inquiry was conducted and for their helpful submissions. I also again extend my condolences to Mr Bellfield and the other family members.

Lastly , I note that Mr Malone's sister, Miss Eve Malone, and a number of family members have attended every day of this Inquiry. They have shown considerable fortitude when hearing and, in some instances, seeing, what must have been for them distressing evidence of the events which led to Mr Malone's death. I have little doubt that they did their best to support Mr Malone, who struggled to overcome his addiction during his life, and have certainly, by their continual presence supported his memory, following upon his death.

This Inquiry was conducted for the Crown by Ms L Ward, Procurator Fiscal Depute. Fife Health Board was represented by Mr Kinroy Q.C. Doctors McKenzie, Pound and Chapman were represented by Mr Jessiman, Solicitor.,erence made to these areas it is because witnesses gave evidence pertinent to these areas and they may be relevant to Fife Health Board's own inquiries and reviews of practices. While it may be little consolation to the family, the Health Board's public acknowledgement of the shortcomings in the care and treatment of Mrs  Dougall was to be welcomed. They do seem to have taken the matter seriously, conducted an internal inquiry and instigated disciplinary proceedings. There was an assurance that matters raised in this Inquiry would be looked at in their ongoing reviews of services.   I would conclude by extending my own sympathy to the family of Mrs  Dougall in their sad loss. They attended the whole Inquiry and listened to evidence which must have been upsetting to hear with great decorum.

Perhaps it would be appropriate on a local or better still on a national level for there to be an attempt to define the status of guidelines and protocols and make sure that all staff at all levels who may be affected are fully educated.   Dr Hughes and others conceded that note taking was not as good as it should have been. I hope lessons have been learned. While it was clear from the evidence from the various team members that communication amongst them was good, that was not always obvious from the state of the clinical notes. Indeed some of the criticism made would have been avoided if proper noting had been done. If it has not already been done, consideration should be given to random auditing of clinical files to check procedures, note taking and the like.

Both he and the Coastal Safety Manager from Stornoway made it clear that the MCA was not in the business of instantaneous rescue and expected a mariner to be able to survive long enough to allow the rescue to be mobilised.   While I recognise the strength of locally held feeling on this matter, I am not in a position to make any further comment about it, having regard to the restricted nature of the evidence led in the course of the inquiry and to the fact that in the circumstances here, an earlier call out would not have been likely, sadly, to have resulted in a different outcome.

Given that there was evidence that not using scotches was normal practice, Ms Foard invited me to find that this was a defect in the system of work which contributed to the accident. I did not do so in those precise terms but took the view that the real issue was the failure to assess and identify that risk. It was suggested that I might find that working in such limited visibility might be seen as a defect in the system of work, but for the reasons outlined I was not persuaded that this contributed to the accident and did not make any finding as suggested.

It would be a matter of fact rather than opinion. At present he said there is no guidance at all for traumatic instrumental perforation.

From this other investigations would have followed. These might not have led immediately to a diagnosis of obstruction, but I consider it likely that Kirsty would have remained in hospital while investigations to explain the tachycardia continued. I cannot determine what precise form the investigations would or should have taken; whether by consulting the missing CRP report, whether by further CRP tests, or tests by ultra sound or X-ray; or at what precise stage a consultant or consultant surgeon would have been involved. I am satisfied, however, that as the underlying pathology developed there was a very lively possibility that her condition would have been identified and her life might have been saved.

Place and time of death John Aitken died within Ward 14 at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, Dumfries on 1 April 2009 at 18.00 hours. 2.   Cause of death His death was caused by 1(a,of Dr Holden's discussions about the seriousness of Mr. Aitken's condition, but also the circumstances in which his death was communicated to Mrs Aitken. That was done in a lift in the hospital following what appeared to be a chance meeting between her and Dr Holden when she had come back into the hospital not long after Mr. Aitken had left his room when the transfer commenced. I have to say this did not seem the most appropriate place to relay to her what was inevitably going to be distressing news. Unfortunately, this was not put to Dr Holden when he gave evidence, so I do not know whether what Mrs Aitken said would have been accepted by him or, if it were, what his explanation might have been. Against that background I am reluctant to form any firm conclusion or make any recommendation.

According to Mr Ilias Dr Shetty indicated that she should try to avoid that. Dr Shetty then went on to advise that her medication would be reviewed in three months and the dosage might (my emphasis) then be increased. Mr Ilias thought this was odd.

However I remain not satisfied that the issue of Christina experiencing disrupted sleep patterns was raised with Dr Shetty at this consultation.

Unfortunately, this event is one more example of health and safety practice, training and procedures being ignored in the interests of expediency with lethal results.

That in respect of subsection (a), Mrs Jessie Taylor died at 0845 on 20 September 2009 , at Queen  Margaret  Hospital , Dunfermline , Fife .     II.   That i,tion was required. That in my view clearly had a bearing on the speed of treatment she received. The section, however, is worded in such a way that I can only make a finding there if the factor was relevant to the circumstances of the death. As it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that the death could have been avoided by earlier treatment, I cannot say that delay in treatment was a circumstance relevant to the death. It was clearly unfortunate, and no doubt lessons have been learned. Dr Hartung in particular was concerned at the delays that had occurred.  [22]    Finally, in thanking all those who gave evidence for their patience and attention to detail, I would express my sympathies to the members of Mrs Taylor's family, who sat through the whole proceedings with great dignity.

The Sheriff, having considered all the evidence adduced, the Joint Minute of Admissions and the submissions made thereon, determines in terms of Section 6 of the Fatal Accident and Sudden Dea,sion was taken to hold an Inquiry. I would also ask why it was thought either necessary or appropriate to lodge so many pages of productions most of which had no bearing on the Inquiry. I spent many hours reading through the productions and I have no doubt that Mr Clark and Ms Lake would spend even longer. The cost of reproduction alone must have been significant never mind the cost of time to the public purse be it the Crown, NHS or Legal Aid. Witnesses had to negotiate their way through the productions which were in 5 volumes. I am not sure if volumes 3 and 4 were referred to at all. If the Crown deems it necessary to hold an Inquiry only relevant documentary productions should be lodged. I accept the need to disclose but what is disclosed does not necessarily need to be lodged in court.

The Sheriff, having resumed consideration of the matter, makes the following findings.  In terms of Section 6(1)(a) that Robert Craig MacDonald, born 24 August 1957 who resided at 97 B,sonable precautions which could have been taken by TKP or BB to have prevented the accident taking place. There was no evidence that there was any defect in any system of working which contributed to the accident resulting in Mr MacDonald's death.   The conclusion, therefore, is that the reason why Mr MacDonald had an accident which resulted in his death was the decision taken by Messrs McGinlay, Muir and MacDonald to disobey all the rules and use an unauthorised route. They knew it was unauthorised and therefore that there might be a hazard but they had no idea what that hazard might have been. Had they gone to their place of work by the approved and authorised route they would not have been on the top unauthorised walkway of the Inchgarvie Cantilever and thus exposing themselves to risk.

Overall, the evidence showed that, from return to hospital on 20 th February, Fraser was not negative; he was co-operative, but he was a deeply troubled young man with unstable emotions and, understandably, was and was likely to be confused about what he wanted to and should do. His troubled state was why he sought the care and assistance that the medical care services were there to provide.   Mr Fordyce made a fitting closing submission, "I would like to pay tribute to Fraser's parents who have endured this inquiry with quiet dignity. Their determination and tenacity in pursuing the holding of this inquiry are a credit to their love of their son."

In terms of Section 6(1)(a) of the Fatal Accidents &amp; Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 ("the Act") that Harry William Emslie (who was born on 6 th Sep,ran dry. At that point the engine stopped. The ignition, of course, remained on. That is the position in which the vehicle was found on the morning of 9 th June.   53. I was invited by Mr Fay to make a finding in terms of Section 6(1)(e) of the Act. That is to say a finding in relation to other facts that are relevant to the circumstances of the death. Mr Fay invited me under this heading to refer to the inclusion of a seat sensor in newer models of this forklift truck. I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to do that. It does not seem to me to be relevant to the circumstances of Mr Emslie's death that subsequent models of this vehicle were fitted with a seat sensor. There were a number of other safety features present in the vehicle which if utilised would have prevented the accident.

Otherwise, in the midst of apparent misunderstandings and inadequate management and supervision of her care, her deterioration was not properly recognised or addressed by the care home or the general practice until it was too late to prevent her death as a result of the progression of the pressure ulcers.   [87] The knowledge that this combination of circumstances was allowed to occur will, I hope, enable care homes and general medical practices, to identify similar factors at an earlier stage and allow measures to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such a situation being allowed to develop.   [88] I close by expressing my personal condolences to Miss MacKenzie's family.

Section 6(1)(a)  Mrs Mary MacAuley died in the bedroom of her house at 149 Crowhill Street , Parkhills, Glasgow between 08:19 and 10:05 on 15 January 2008 2. Section 6(1)(b)  The cause of death was ischaemic and hypertensive heart disease.  3. Section 6(1)(c)  A reasonable precaution which mig,ice been alerted immediately that Mrs MacAuley would have survived. Clearly she had many health challenges to face. However, there was a lively possibility that a different reaction to her call by the direct alarm service might have avoided her death.   A review of the procedure for the categorisation of calls by the DACS alarm service may prevent other deaths in the future. I fully appreciate that some distinction has to be drawn in order to ensure that emergency services are not troubled by nuisance calls. However it was a grave defect in the system of working which allowed a call constituting a genuine cry for help to be categorised in the same way as an inadvertent pressing of the alarm or nuisance call.

In terms of section 6(1)(a) of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry ( Scotland ) Act 1976:  Catherine Hattie, born 7 September 1926, formerly residing at 154 Hillhead Road, Kirkintilloch died in Ward 5 of Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow at about 2.40 am on,submissions for the family under this head, but I have not identified in those submissions any matter on which I think it appropriate to make a determination. I do, however, consider that the point about earlier intravenous administration of fluids is a fact relevant to the circumstances of the death, which is appropriate for inclusion under this head of my determination. I accept the clear and unshaken view of the expert witness, Dr Primrose, that intravenous fluids should have been set up and administered soon after Mrs Hattie's fall, rather than at 11.50pm when they were first recorded as being administered. This would have been a reasonable course of action in the circumstances, albeit that any potential benefit in terms of outcome was only remote, and not a real or lively possibility.

I agree, however with the Crown's submission to the effect that such considerations are not relevant to a determination of a fatal accident inquiry. (49)   Finally, at the conclusion of submissions, I commended agents and Mr Copeland for their substantial contribution. Particular mention should be made of Mr Copeland. His questioning of all the witnesses was highly relevant and he has displayed great courage, dignity and professionalism throughout the conduct of this Inquiry. The consequences of this fatal road traffic collision were devastating - the sudden and premature loss of a wife and two daughters must have been devastating to Mr Copeland. I conjoin with all others involved in the conduct of this Inquiry in conveying to Mr Copeland my sincere condolences for his tragic loss.

That is not to apportion blame to any one individual, but is simply to state what I understood to be agreed by almost all who gave evidence; that if certain things had been done differently, the outcome would undoubtedly have been different.

I have already stated that I was extremely impressed by the manner in which Mr Laing gave his evidence.

In terms of section 6 of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976, the Sheriff, having considered the evidence and the submissions, FINDS AND DET,d many friends and was a much loved family member. Unfortunately, he had a weakness for drugs and on the evening of 21 August through to early hours of 22 August 2010, Mr Irvine consumed a lethal combination of drugs. Others suspected that the drugs consumed by Mr Irvine had been adulterated. I do not know whether Mr Irvine realised this but carried on regardless or whether he was unaware that the drugs may have been adulterated.  [107] Mr Irvine's family attended each day listening intently to evidence which must, at times, have been difficult to hear. Mr Irvine was described variously as the life and soul of a party and having lived a life at a hundred miles per hour. I have no doubt that he will be missed by his friends and family. I send my condolences to them for their loss.   SHERIFF

It does not seem to me, based upon the evidence I heard that Darren Taylor's view of the overhead wires would have been improved had he been using an overhead device.  18. I do not accept that there was nowhere within the yard where there was adequate space and it was safe to unload for Mr Taylor but even had that been the situation I would have expected him to have gone back to the farmhouse and to have stated that there was insufficient room and ask for somewhere else to unload.  19. Finally I would wish to add my condolences to those already expressed to Mr Taylor's family and to thank them for the dignity and patience with which they conducted themselves throughout the hearing of this case.

[2] Mr Gra,  56.  I note the changes made by the Crown to their procedures for the investigation and conduct of Fatal Accident Inquiries. I urge the Crown to ensure that the procedures now in place are sufficient to avoid any family having to endure such long delays as occurred here.  57.  It is to be hoped that with increased awareness and understanding of the risks associated with dialysis, the tragic circumstances of the death of Mr McAllister are less likely to happen again. That may be of some little consolation to his daughters who suffered the loss of a much loved father. That his death might have been avoided must be a source of great sadness to his family. I offer my condolences to the family for their loss in such sad circumstances.     Glasgow, 28 March 2011. Sheriff Johanna Johnston, Q.C.

In terms of section 6(1)(a), Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 that Sharon Harkin, born 8 June 1962, formerly residing at 18/6 Norfolk Court, Glasgow, then while in lawful custody at HMP Cornton Vale, Sti, officers in the employment of the Scottish Prison Service were made available for precognition, and in particular whether it was reasonable for a legal representative of the Prison Service to be present. I understand that this matter was dealt with at a preliminary hearing and I decline to make further comment.  Mr. MacNeill requested that a copy of this Determination should be intimated to the Justice Secretary as Minister responsible for the Scottish Prison Service and that will be done in terms of section 6(4)(a)(iv) of the 1976 Act.

That pursuant to Section 6(1)(a) Ainslie Alexander Smith, born 14 December 2008 died on 4 July 2009 between the, the company. Equally it would not be appropriate for me to make a finding that they did know of the defect as that would be going beyond the scope of this Inquiry.   On behalf of the family Mr Anderson invited me to make certain determinations in terms of Section 6(1)(e) in relation to the management of Cosatto and their design process. I was not prepared to do that. It does not seem to me that it is appropriate in a determination in a Fatal Accident Inquiry to make recommendations to an individual company as to how they should manage their business in order to comply with the law. The law requires them to provide a particular result and in this case a safe product. How they do it is a matter for their management.   I would again express my condolences to the family for their tragic loss.
