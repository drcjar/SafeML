An earlier petition was withdrawn as a result of investigations being undertaken by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency ("VOSA") [the executive agency of the Department of Transport which has certain licensing, testing and enforcement functions relative to vehicles and their operators and drivers], following receipt by them of an anonymous letter which suggested that lorry drivers working out of Livingston Distribution Centre routinely adopted certain practices to enable them to complete their duties more quickly, such as habitually exceeding the speed limit, and classifying as rest breaks periods when they were unloading their vehicles. In particular, the letter, the terms of which were agreed in the joint minute mentioned in the next paragraph, included the following (the spelling and grammar are the letter writer's own):</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;

First, clause (9) of the minute was in the following terms:</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>"In so far as written statements are lodged in process in place of the parole evidence of any witness, the said written statements are true and accurate records of the evidence of the said witnesses to which they relate and are to be taken as being equivalent to oral evidence; and more particularly reference is made in this regard to the written statements of the following witnesses: ... ." </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There then follows a list of 34 witnesses. There were in fact no written statements from two of the witnesses listed, the police officers who had prepared the collision investigation report; no doubt the report sufficiently constituted their evidence. With the exception of a statement from a Beverly Stoner, a VOSA traffic examiner of five years' experience, who had provided her own statement, the 32 listed witness statements were all taken by the police. (I append the list at the end of this Note, with a brief description of what the witnesses speak to.) More significantly, within the papers are statements, or documents identified as statements, from another four witnesses, none of whose names appears on the list, and all of whom either had been or still were (at least when the statements were taken) lorry drivers operating out of Livingston Distribution Centre. In the case of these four statements, two of them might more properly be described as interview transcripts, since they contain both questions and answers, and the witnesses were cautioned, advised they could terminate the interviews at any time, and also advised that they could seek legal advice. These two interviews were conducted by Mrs Stoner, with a police officer also present. The other two statements follow the normal narrative statement structure. They were taken by police officers, in one instance with Mrs Stoner present. One of the question and answer interviewees was William Wood Millar, the driver who had accompanied the deceased on the north east run during which the accident under consideration happened. By the time of the accident, all the deliveries had been completed, and Mr Millar's lorry was almost back at the distribution centre, the deceased, as I mention later, having stopped driving for a period of about 43 minutes in the vicinity of Alnwick. However, one would have expected that Mr Millar could have given information about what had happened at the various delivery stops, and it is perhaps surprising that no statement specifically dealing with these matters was taken from him, or at least was put before me, particularly given the allegations contained in the anonymous letter, together with the information obtained from the tachograph in the deceased's lorry, as mentioned later. In the interview Mr Millar was not questioned specifically about the north east run of 9/10 July, although he and the other three witnesses did deal more generally with the practices of drivers making deliveries out of the Livingston Delivery Centre. In relation to the contents of these interviews/statements, they seem to me to raise many more concerns than were touched on in the anonymous letter, but the question is whether I can have regard to them. I would not propose to do so. It is open to doubt that they are covered by clause (9) of the joint minute, and in any event, many of the practices that they describe are not relevant, or in any event cannot be demonstrably linked, to the deceased's driving on 9/10 July.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[6] Clause (11) of the joint minute narrates that the substance commonly known as mephedrone was added to Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 when The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment Order) 2010 [2010 SI 1207] came into force on 16 April 2010. It states that Crown Production 10 - it should in fact be Crown Production 11 - is a copy of that statutory instrument. Part 2 of Schedule 2 specifies those drugs which are subject to control as Class B drugs under the Act. The statutory instrument refers not only to mephedrone (the common name for 4-methylmethcathinone) but also to some other cathinone derivatives. Cathinone itself and yet other cathinone derivatives were already controlled under the Act. There seems to be no doubt that clause (11) was intended <i>inter alia</i> to have some connection with a foil packet containing a quantity of pale brown powder which was recovered from the deceased's trouser pocket following the accident. Clause (8) of the joint minute agrees the conclusions of Crown Production 8, a joint forensic report analysing the powder. In terms of that report:</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;

I did ask about it without objection from anyone at the hearing. (I have to say I had not appreciated at the time that it was not covered by the joint minute, and it seems hard to see why it should not be. No one, as indicated, objected to me hearing about it, and in particular no one advised me of any reason why it had deliberately not been agreed.) According to Crown Production 9:</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;

On the basis of the agreed analysis of the powder contained in clause (8), and the very limited result thereof, it is difficult to see the relevance of clause (11). To complete the picture, the post mortem report, Crown Production 7, agreed as accurate in clause (1) of the joint minute, indicated that there was an unconfirmed indication of Ibuprofen in the deceased's blood, and that it was further examined for other acidic drugs, basic drugs, amphetamine related compounds, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylamphetamine and related compounds, methadone, morphine and opiates with negative results. (The report goes on to say "There is no indication that Mephedrone has been specifically tested for." However, Crown Production 7 is dated </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>19 January 2011</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;

font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>.) I might finally say that the witness statements included a statement from a clinical scientist at the hospital to which Mr Cain was taken. She handed pre-transfusion blood samples taken from Mr Cain to two police officers, and their witness statements confirm that. No further mention is made of these samples, and I assume that nothing untoward emerged from any analysis of Mr Cain's blood, if such took place.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[7] As indicated, written submissions were tendered on behalf of all the parties at the hearing. I need not refer to them in detail. All the parties invited me to make findings only in terms of section 6(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. In relation to section 6(1)(b), all the parties, including the Crown, did not seek a finding in relation to the underlying cause behind the accident. The most that Mr O'Reilly for the Crown did was to suggest in his summary of facts that "some unknown reason, most likely fatigue or some as yet unknown medical condition [caused the deceased] to lose consciousness and/or control." Ms Price made reference in her written submissions to the case of <i>Black v Scott Lithgow Ltd</i> 1990 SC 322, and to comments made by Sheriff Principal J S Mowat QC in his determination following the fatal accident inquiry relative to the Lockerbie Air Disaster, reproduced in Carmichael, <i>Sudden Deaths and Fatal Accident Inquiries (3<sup>rd</sup> ed)</i>, para 11.10.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The evidence and my conclusions thereon</span></b></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[8] The one matter addressed in written and oral submissions by all the parties was the immediate mechanism of the accident. An issue arose because Mr Spedding, one of the listed witnesses, a lorry driver who came upon the accident immediately following its occurrence, although he did not witness it, had formed the following conclusion, as expressed somewhat tentatively in his statement:</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>"It's hard to say what happened but I thought the guy heading southbound [i.e. Mr Cain] had lost control or overtaken somebody and I got the impression from the debris that he was in the right hand southbound lane, had the impact and then ricocheted right over to the left hand side of the carriageway."</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;

I know the speed camera is just round the corner, this is a slight right hand bend. I suddenly became aware of another lorry coming north towards me. I was in the nearside lane and I thought to myself, 'Why's he coming over the white lines into my side of the road?", I would be lucky if I was doing 25 mph, he just kept coming, further and further and I knew I had to move NOW. I turned the unit into the verge and I thought I was going to be okay, but he still kept coming towards me. I heard the bang and I knew straight away that I'd been hit on the front corner on my driver's side ... ."</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[9] I was satisfied, as submitted by all the parties, that I could resolve this issue on the papers. I mention first the road layout. As indicated, the accident occurred on a hill. The deceased was driving downhill, on a road which, for him, had a shallow left hand bend. Mr Cain was driving uphill. The southbound, uphill, carriageway had two lanes, including an inner "crawler" lane. The northbound carriageway had one lane. The northbound and southbound carriageways were separated by double white lines. Given that he had the benefit of two lanes going in his direction, there would appear to be no need for Mr Cain to encroach upon the opposing carriageway, were there a vehicle for him to overtake. Further, the accident was investigated by two very experienced police officers, Constables James Brunton and Malcolm Burt, both with many years' experience as road policing officers, and both based at police headquarters in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
  200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Fettes Avenue</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Edinburgh</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>, the former in the Collision Investigation Unit and the latter in the Road Policing Unit. As mentioned earlier, a collision investigation report compiled by Constable Brunton and corroborated by Constable Burt is produced as Crown Production 1, and is agreed in clause (3) of the joint minute. Examination of the accident scene indicated that the collision had taken place well within the southbound carriageway. The officers' conclusion was:</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>"the Volvo LGV has been approaching the locus from the south when he has failed to negotiate the shallow left hand bend, crossing the double solid white line and colliding head on with the southbound Daf LGV which had just negotiated Cockburnspath roundabout and had been accelerating up the hill towards the locus."</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='margin-left:36.85pt;text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In relation to the last phrase, I should say that the speed to which Mr Cain had accelerated was 37 mph (as calculated from the vehicle's tachograph). As far as the speed of the deceased's vehicle was concerned, it was 53 mph, significantly in excess of the legal limit of 40 mph for vehicles of that kind on the road in question. The officers also note that the deceased's vehicle had been driving at a constant speed of 53 mph (85 kph) for a period of time prior to the collision, which in their view "could indicate that the vehicle was being driven either on cruise control or at its limited speed" (which has a possible resonance with the allegations contained in the anonymous letter). Having regard to the evidence mentioned, I was satisfied that Mr Cain's account of the accident was substantially reliable, and that Mr Spedding's view as to how it occurred should be rejected. (As to why Mr Spedding reached that view, I suspect it may be because the deceased's vehicle ended up diagonally across both carriageways, with the tractor unit in particular back in the northbound carriageway.) What I have said thus far obviously leaves aside the question of why the accident might have happened. Anticipating what I say more fully later, there are a number of factors suggesting that the deceased might have been so tired that he fell asleep or at least lost concentration at the wheel. Such an occurrence seems to me to fit quite well with the nature of the accident.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[9] The collision incident report records that the deceased's vehicle and trailer (and also Mr Cain's vehicle and trailer) were examined by a Constable Stephen Wilson and a VOSA vehicle examiner Douglas Pugh on 12 July 2010, and that no mechanical defects were found on either vehicle which could have contributed to the accident. The maintenance and testing record for the deceased's tractor unit was produced as DHL Exel Production 3 and agreed in clause (15) of the joint minute.

From the witness statements it appears that it was raining quite heavily around the time of the accident and probably at the time of the accident. In his statement, Mr Spedding is recorded as saying that "it was raining and very slippy, so much so that I lifted the 3<sup>rd</sup> axle, the lift axle on the road, which gives you extra grip on the road." Another witness, Leanne Mair, who was following the deceased's route and came upon the accident very shortly after it had happened, stated in her statement that it was raining really heavily, she was going slow, about 50 mph, the road conditions were quite dangerous, she was worried about aquaplaning, and had aquaplaned slightly on the way back up [in her Peugeot 206 Sport]. In his witness statement, Police Sergeant Neil Inglis, who arrived at the locus at </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>3.17 a.m.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>, recorded that "the road surface was wet and actually greasy and slippery underfoot", this being unrelated to any accident debris. All of that said, Constables Brunton and Burt also attended at the scene of the accident shortly after its occurrence, and were aware of the weather conditions. They did mention the rain in their report, but solely in the context that it and the darkness would not have created any sight restrictions. It seems reasonable to infer that they would have made an express reference to the wet and slippery nature of the road surface had they considered that it might have caused or contributed to the accident.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[11] In relation to the deceased, it is necessary to give some biographical information.

The deceased's lorry was equipped with a digital tachograph, and analysis of the tachograph and driver card data receives mention in both the collision investigation report and Mrs Stoner's statement. I should say something about the regulations relating to drivers such as the deceased. These are found in EC Regulation 561/2006. They define daily and weekly rest periods during which a driver may freely dispose of his time, e.g. the "regular weekly rest period" means any period of rest of at least 45 hours. DHL Exel Production 8, as agreed in clause (20) of the joint minute, is the three page "agency control form" which the deceased was required to sign when reporting for duty on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
 font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>9 July 2010</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>. On page 1, the deceased has signed to confirm that he has read and fully understood all statements made on the form, and that he has answered questions truthfully. At heading 6e, he answers yes to the question, "Have you taken the necessary daily and weekly rest before reporting for duty with DHL today?" He also <i>inter alia</i> confirms that he has had no change in health which would affect his entitlement to drive. In addition to rest periods, the regulations define the break periods a driver must have in the course of his duties, "break" meaning "any period during which a driver may not carry out any driving or any other work and which is used exclusively for recuperation." To quote from Mrs Stoner's statement:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.85pt'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>"A driver is permitted to drive for a total accumulative period not exceeding 41/2 hours before a break of 45 minutes is observed. This 45 minute break can be split into two breaks the latter of which must be a minimum of 30 minutes. The first break must be a minimum of 15 minutes and if the break has been split then both breaks must be taken within 41/2 hours of driving. The recording equipment fitted to both of these vehicles [i.e. the deceased's and Mr Millar's - Ms Stoner was asked to analyse their driver's hours' records] is digital. The technical regulations governing the functionality and fitment of the digital recording equipment (tachograph) specifies that the vehicle will automatically record driving when the vehicle is in motion and when stationary the mode will automatically default to 'work' therefore a driver has to manually change the mode switch to record rest by physical action."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.85pt'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

[UTC stands for Universal Time Co-ordinated, the time measurement used in digital tachographs, equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time. I only quote hereafter the British Summer Time (BST) time. The deceased's tachograph was subsequently found to be one minute fast, which is why I have specified in my determination the time of the collision as </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>2.47 a.m.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>] He has then continued working/driving until another second rest break of 33 minutes duration at 23.28hrs BST till 00.01hrs BST.

The second part of his break is declared as 33 minutes at Southwick (the third delivery point), however this is inconsistent as there is no declared time at Southwick covering the time for unloading the eight pallets he delivered at that store. It would be fair to assume that some if not all of the 33 minutes recorded as rest at the Southwick store should have been recorded as 'other work' to cover the unloading of the vehicle. From Southwick the digital data then shows him driving for a period of 59 minutes, this is then followed by a period of 43 minutes recorded as 'other work', this is the mode the tachograph automatically defaults to when the vehicle is stationary, again it would be fair to assume that this was in fact a period of rest where the driver has forgot to change his mode switch to rest. It is at this point that the two vehicles become split.

Using Autoroute calculations it is likely that he stopped somewhere near to Alnwick, Northumberland. The vehicle is then stationary for a period of 43 minutes, at the point of stopping he had been on duty for 6 hours 02 minutes. He had driven for a total of 4 hours 40 minutes. At 0145 hrs he commences what would turn out to be the last leg of this journey, driving for a period of 1 hour 3 minutes at which point the collision occurs at Cockburnspath.

This would amount to a cumulative driving period of 4 hrs 40 minutes. When considered in conjunction with the drivers activities throughout the shift, it is my opinion that this could be considered negligible. Therefore I report that analysis of the digital data for driver Iain Boyle shows no evidence that lack of breaks or excessive duty or driving time played a part in the resulting road traffic collision."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.85pt'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>I have already said that no witnesses were called. In the case of Mrs Stoner, Crown Production 10, as agreed in clause (10) of the joint minute, is a letter from her indicating that she will be unavailable for the fatal accident inquiry on account of her confinement. I do find her absence regrettable. A number of different elements are involved in the regulatory regime for goods vehicle drivers, <i>inter alia</i> the maximum number of hours a driver can work in the course of the day, the daily and weekly rest periods that must be observed, and the breaks that a driver must take in the course of his driving duties. Compliance with one element does not necessarily mean compliance with another element. There are a number of areas where I think it would have been useful to have heard more from Mrs Stoner. Mr O'Reilly has perhaps interpreted what Mrs Stoner says in her statement as meaning that the allegations in the anonymous letter have been disproven. It would have been helpful to hear Mrs Stoner confirm that, or otherwise, as well as deal with the other information she was given in the course of her investigations. In relation to the night of 9/10 July itself, it would have been helpful to know why Mrs Stoner does not appear to question the genuineness of the first 18 minute break taken by the deceased. If it was a genuine break period, and the deceased did have a 43 minute break in the region of Alnwick, then it may be that he did get the break minutes to which he was entitled in not much more than the correct time. However, the anonymous letter suggests that doing the run for any period of time catches up on a driver, and it would have been helpful to know to what extent the previous runs had been considered. It appears plain that the runs could ordinarily be completed within the maximum permissible number of driving hours - I would accept that there must have been some exceptional occurrence on 23 February 2010 to prevent that - but it would have been helpful if Mrs Stoner had been able to clarify whether her analysis had extended to the speed of the vehicles and confirmation that what were shown as break periods were indeed break periods.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

As noted, all parties invited me only to make findings in terms of section 6(1)(a) and, in limited form, section 6(1)(b) of the Act. When and where the accident and the death occurred were clearly established, and indeed were identical. (In terms of certain witness statements, life was declared extinct by an unidentified paramedic probably around </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;

In relation to the cause of death, it was multiple injuries sustained in the accident. So far as the cause of the accident was concerned, at the most basic level, it was the deceased's vehicle crossing from the northbound carriageway into the southbound and coming into collision with Mr Cain's vehicle. As to what caused the deceased's vehicle to do that, as indicated, no party invited me to make findings upon that question, Mr O'Reilly at best suggesting that the deceased lost consciousness or control due to "some unknown reason, most likely fatigue or some as yet unknown medical condition", a phrase repeated in the collision incident report. On the evidence before me, there is much to suggest that the deceased would have been fatigued. He was working as much as he could to finance his studies, and during the day prior to commencing work on 9 July, the domestic duties he undertook seem to allow little time for rest. He in fact was working unloading his lorry during at least one of the periods identified as a break period. The stimulant drug which he had taken is perhaps a two edged sword. If it worked, it would have assisted in keeping him awake, but the fact that he was using it suggests that he was fatigued. Conversely, there is little to suggest that some unexplained medical condition led to the accident. The post mortem indicates that the deceased was a healthy and comparatively young man. His moderate localised heart disease, in terms of the doctors' findings, played no part in his death. Assessing the matter on the balance of probabilities, there is much to support the inference that driver fatigue caused the accident. There is nothing to support the inference that it was caused by an unexplained medical condition, and there seems no need to add such a phrase as an alternative. I therefore simply find, on the balance of probabilities, that the accident was caused by driver fatigue. In relation to paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 6(1), I am constrained by the evidence which was led. I cannot positively find that reasonable precautions which might have prevented the accident and resulting death were omitted, or that defects in the working system contributed to the accident and death. So far as section 6(1)(e) is concerned, I do not think I need make any specific findings.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
