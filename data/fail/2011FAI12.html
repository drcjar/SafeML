According to the nursing notes Mr. Wylie had collapsed at the police station and suffered a cardiac arrest. CPR was ongoing. Under the heading of "intervention" it is noted that observations were unrecordable at arrival within the department. There was no pulse. The indications were consistent with cardiac arrest. Dr. Denny was responsible for passing a tube into Mr. Wylie's lungs in an attempt to assist him in breathing. Mr. Wylie was heard to make occasional gasps which he referred to as "agonal respirations". The Dr. referred to this as a respiratory effort which occurs at the end of life. Dr. Denny outlined the further procedure which was carried out on Mr. Wylie. He referred to the protocol which was used for patients such as Mr. Wylie. On two occasions the defibrillator was used to administer two shocks in an attempt to instigate a heart beat. Initially there was a brief success and electrical rhythm started but with a very faint pulse. However, that did not last long unfortunately. Adrenalin was administered with further CPR. Every step of normal procedure was carried out, but Mr. Wylie was found to be asystolic, showing no heartbeat and in cardiac arrest.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:71.85pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

He was referred to production no. 3 which was a copy of his report. He noted minor scattered bruises and abrasions to the forehead, face and lips together with abrasions to the knuckles of the left hand and bruises and abrasions to both forearms and elbows. There were minor scraping abrasions to the inside of the right kneecap and bruising to the right shin. These injuries would have been in keeping with involvement in a fight shortly prior to death. There had been no skull fracture or underlying brain injury. His sternum was fractured in keeping with medical attempts at resuscitation. The autopsy revealed severe hardening and narrowing of one of the three main blood vessels supplying blood to the heart (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease). That vessel seemed to be occluded by a flap-like fragment of ruptured plaque, which was a recognised acute complication of chronic atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. In addition the right coronary ostium which represents the origin of the right coronary artery was also moderately narrowed by atherosclerosis. The lungs were flooded by fluid which is a common feature of terminal heart failure. The autopsy revealed no internal injuries. Death was attributed primarily to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It was well recognised that a rise in pulse rate and blood pressure associated with emotional upset and physical exertion or injury may precipitate a disturbance in the electrical rhythm of the heart or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Therefore if there had been any involvement in an altercation and minor blunt injury then these would be viewed as significant contributory factors to Mr. Wylie's death. The injuries in themselves would not have been fatal but the sequence of events strongly suggested that the stress associated with the altercation precipitated death from pre existing natural disease.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:71.85pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Death was attributable primarily to that cause. I also accept Dr. Sadler's opinion that it was well recognised that a rise in pulse rate and blood pressure associated with the emotional upset, physical exertion or injury can precipitate a disturbance in the electrical rhythm of the heart. In that way involvement in an altercation and minor blunt force injuries are viewed as significant contributory factors. Although the injuries in themselves would not have been fatal, the sequence of events strongly suggested that the stress associated with the altercation precipitated Mr. Wylie's death from his pre-existing natural disease.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:71.85pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
