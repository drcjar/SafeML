That is because the pressure difference from the venous needle dislodging is in the region of 13 -25 mmHg. This is a relatively small drop in pressure because some pressure is retained in the system when a needle dislodges and the blood still has to pass through the needle and the fistula. The lower limit for this type of machine is set at a minimum of minus 20 mmHG. If the machine is set at that lower limit the alarm may still not be activated when the venous needle is dislodged as the pressure may not drop by as much as 20 mmHG. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:40.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

When the venous needle became dislodged the lower limit of 40 mmHG was unlikely to be achieved and the alarm activated. The alarm would have been more likely to sound if the lower limit had been set at the lowest limit for that machine, namely 20 mmHG. This could have been done manually but would not have guaranteed the alarm sounding as the pressure may not have fallen to that level. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:40.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
