As far as Mr Sutherland was aware no paperwork had been delivered to them when they purchased the machine but subsequently they had obtained from the manufacturers an instruction manual. A service file on the vehicle had been built up by Umax Limited and such items as weekly sheets were recorded in this. He explained how the machine had been used with a heavy duty forklift and he spoke of it being approximately 30 tonnes in weight. Umax Limited had made various modifications to the vehicle including a forklift attachment, a hydraulic valve and filling the back tyres with water and antifreeze as extra ballast. This made the machine heavier. Mr William Munro of Munro &amp; Sons (Highland) Limited had indicated to Umax Limited that he was interested in purchasing the machine and Mr Munro and Mr Gillies of Munro &amp; Sons (Highland) Limited met with Mr Sutherland on site two days before the accident. The Wheeled Shovel had not been used for some time and Umax had removed the forklift attachment and the hydraulic valve from the machine, reinstating the bucket to convert the machine back to an earth moving machine. Mr Sutherland had worked with Mr Gillies previously and it was agreed that Mr Gillies would test drive the vehicle. Accordingly Mr Gillies climbed into the cab and endeavoured to start the machine but was unable to move it. Mr Sutherland showed Mr Gillies how to release the parking brake and thereafter Mr Gillies test drove the vehicle for ten minutes while Mr Sutherland spoke to Mr Munro. Mr Sutherland explained to Mr Munro that the vehicle weighed approximately 30 tonnes and that they had filled the rear wheels with water for extra ballast. Following further inspection Mr Munro asked whether they could trial the vehicle further at Mr Munro's own site and Umax Limited's driver drove the vehicle through the industrial estate to Munro &amp; Sons (</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Highland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>) Limited's waste transfer station.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[6] The vehicle was left with Mr Gillies and Mr Sutherland next heard from Mr Gillies on the day of the accident at approximately lunchtime when Mr Gillies phoned him to say that the machine was suitable and that "Mr Munro would have to get his cheque book out". Mr Sutherland took from this that the purchase would go ahead and an invoice would have to be raised by his employers. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[7] Mr Sutherland heard later that day that the vehicle had been involved in an accident at the Tomich junction and although he had no knowledge that Munro &amp; Sons (Highland) Limited were intending to move the machine out of their premises and take it to the quarry at Kindeace, nonetheless he would not have objected to this. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[8] Mr Gillies told Mr Sutherland on the phone at the scene of the accident that the chains had broken when the low-loader was going up the hill from Tomich towards Kindeace.

He later told Mr Gillies that they would be receiving an invoice for the machine but shortly after that Mr Munro phoned to say that they were no longer interested in purchasing the Wheeled Shovel.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[10] Although Mr Sutherland had worked as a machine operator, he was not mechanically qualified and his evidence was that he was not aware of the link between the service brake and the parking brake. He spoke of how the parking disc had been changed in May 2005 and that he had noted from the records that in December 2005 the parking brake had not been holding in reverse and was in need of adjustment. This adjustment had required to be repeated in January 2006 when the machine had ceased being used by Umax Limited and from the records Mr Sutherland was of the view that the vehicle was working perfectly and could be advertised for sale. As far as Mr Sutherland was concerned, you could test the parking brake by endeavouring to move the Wheeled Shovel while the parking brake was engaged and if the parking brake was working the machine would not move. He did accept that the braking system should have been checked before the vehicle had been offered to Munro &amp; Sons (Highland) Limited for sale. He explained, however, that the manufacturers' requirement was that the parking brake should be checked every 500 hours and between January and July 2006 the Wheeled Shovel had only been used for 10 to 20 hours and accordingly he felt that the brake did not require further adjustment. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[11] Mr Sutherland stated that if he had known that the brakes were in any way defective he would not have allowed the machine to be used. He stated that when Mr Gillies had been test driving the vehicle he, Mr Sutherland, had thought that the parking brake was holding because the vehicle would not move when the parking brake was on. He accepted that he might have been fooled as to the efficiency of the parking brake if the service brake had cut in but stated that he had no concerns about the machine being delivered to Mr Munro or its safety. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[12] The court then heard from Angus Gillies, Contracts Manager for Munro Construction, who had previous experience as a plant operator. He stated that he had been asked by his employer, Mr Munro, to look at the Michigan L190 as they were interested in buying it for use at the waste transfer station. He had not used a Michigan L190 before but was familiar with vehicles of that type. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[13] He stated that he had not carried out any check of the parking brake but spoke to the braking system of the L190 being of a complicated nature.

Unfortunately, the Wheeled Shovel could not lift a load high enough and the vehicle would not fit onto their weighbridge. Accordingly he phoned Mr Sutherland to see whether they could take the vehicle to try it at their quarry but he had no recollection of indicating that his employers were happy with the vehicle or were going to buy it. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[15] He explained how he was unable to move the vehicle backwards or forwards with the handbrake on and he was able to tell Mr MacLennan, the low-loader driver, that as far as he was concerned the brakes seemed to be in good order.

He spoke of an attempt to weigh the L190 on the weighbridge but that it had been too big. He told the court that the driver from Umax Limited had explained to him that the vehicle was of about 30 tonnes. He explained that on the day of the accident Mr William Munro had telephoned him in order that he, Mr Spark, might tell Walter MacLennan to load the machine onto the low-loader. He had done so but at the same time had told Mr MacLennan that the vehicle was large and would make him overweight. Mr Spark advised the tribunal that if that was the case then they would not move the vehicle. Mr Spark advised the court that he had phoned Mr Munro to convey the message that Mr MacLennan did not want to put the machine on the trailer and Mr Munro had replied "we'll soon see about that", appearing later at the waste transfer station where an argument ensued between Mr Munro and Mr MacLennan. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[19] Mr Spark advised the court that his employer, Mr William Munro, never bought anything that he should and spoke of the chains for the company having to be obtained from a skip.

His findings were contained within a report lodged (Crown Production No. 3). He explained that when he examined the vehicle the parking brake was not working and had not been working for some time.

He spoke of the vehicle being of approximately 30 tonnes and that it was common practice for such vehicles to have their wheels filled with ballast. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[36] I heard from Mr William Munro, Director of Munro &amp; Sons (</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Highland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>) Limited, who stated that Mr Gillies suggested to him that they might consider purchasing the Wheeled Loader for their waste transfer station. Accordingly both he and Mr Gillies went to Umax Limited and Mr Gillies drove the vehicle. He was advised by Mr Sutherland of Umax Limited that the L190 was about 26 tonnes but stated that Mr Sutherland had not mentioned to him the fact that the wheels had been loaded with water. On learning that the L190 was not suitable for use in the waste transfer station, Mr Munro authorised its transfer to their quarry at Kindeace and contacted Mr MacLennan and instructed him to move the L190 to the quarry at Kindeace. He categorically refuted the evidence of Mr Spark regarding any disagreement between himself and Mr MacLennan and advised the court that other than instructing Mr MacLennan to move the vehicle, he was not involved in any way in the organisation of the transfer. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[37] Mr Munro advised the court that his company relied on the experience of their drivers and it was a firm requirement that only trained and competent persons should load and unload vehicles. Although there was no particular risk assessment carried out, the particular driver had a duty to ensure that the load was secure. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[38] Mr Munro indicated that he had not told the driver anything about the weight of the L190 but his company would not have moved the machine if it had known its weight.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[39] Mr Munro indicated that he was not aware of the Code of Practice on loading vehicles in 2006 and had stated that he had, over a number of years, tried to ascertain whether or not there were any available courses for drivers in securing loads but found that none were available. Although drivers were not sent on courses, his company carried out its own training of drivers and he felt that there was no need to carry out a particular risk assessment of transportation of a particular load unless there was something out of the ordinary in the load. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[40] Mr Munro did not accept that the two chains used by Mr MacLennan were inadequate and made mention of the calculation by his son regarding the force required to pull the machine off the back of the trailer. He felt that Mr MacLennan had properly secured the vehicle and that it was reasonable for his firm to rely on the parking brake as a means of restraint. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[41] I then heard from Mr Nick Norton who had been asked by the police to prepare a report on the method of loading of the Michigan L190 (Crown Production No. 6). Mr Norton had considerable experience in the transportation of heavy equipment, both military and civilian spheres. He was a construction industry training board examiner and was involved in training and lecturing in the haulage industry. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[42] He spoke of the interlocking system of braking on the Michigan L190 and stated that anyone who was unfamiliar with the machine might be fooled in to thinking that the parking brake was holding when in fact it was the service brake which was in action. He spoke of it being common practice to have such machines as the L190 ballasted to give them more traction and therefore more effective use. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[43] He stated that the chains used by Munro Construction (</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Highland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>) Limited were not sufficient for the task. Even although the parking brake had been set there still should have been sufficient restraint in the chains. He indicated that in his view there should have been at least four chains used. The restraint should have been sufficient for 100% in a forward motion, 50% in a rearward motion and 50% in a sideways motion. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[44] Although every load was different, Mr Norton referred to the Department for Transport Code of Practice and spoke of the necessity of a risk assessment being carried out prior to transportation of the load. Clearly the driver would require to know the weight of the load to avoid his vehicle being overloaded and to ensure that the restraint chains were adequate for the task. He spoke of the necessity of two chains with a restraint of 30 tonnes in the forward motion and two chains capable of 15 tonnes restraining in the rearward motion. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[45] As far as the use of the parking brake as a means of restraint, Mr Norton accepted that the parking brake was in fact a means of restraint but spoke of it only being used as a bonus and should not be relied on. Even if the driver had known that the parking brake was not working properly, the machine shovel could still have been securely transported. In addition to the use of chains, Mr Norton spoke of the necessity to use chocks or timbers under the wheels as a method of restraint.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[46] Mr Norton spoke of how the Department of Transport's Code of Practice Safety of Loads on Vehicles (Crown Production No. 13) offered guidance on best practice to the haulage industry and was well known by the industry as a whole. He spoke of a CITB Certificate on load restraint which was available to all companies. This involved training and testing of the applicants, including on-site assessment of their loading. Some companies who did not use the CITB Certificate system had their own in-house training and stated also that the Freight Transport Association, the Board of Hauliers Association and other training providers all ran courses on loading and restraining loads. He indicated that there was three training companies offering loading courses in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>, one in Roxburghshire, one in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>West Lothian</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> and one with the IV19 postcode. These could be accessed through information from the HSE website, VOSA or the Freight Transport Association or Road Haulage Association. He felt that there should be compulsory loading training for all HGV drivers. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[47] On any view, the tragic death of Christina Fraser was an accident which could so easily have been avoided. Whilst there is little doubt that the parking brake was not working properly when Umax Limited allowed Munro &amp; Sons (Highland) Limited to test the Wheeled Shovel and the interlocking facility of the braking system could confuse anyone other than someone experienced in the use of such a machine, nonetheless this accident was caused by insufficient chains (both in number and in strength) being used to restrain a load which was in excess of the weight allowed to be carried on the vehicle in question. The driver had not carried out any risk assessment prior to transportation. He had no knowledge of the weight of the load and the chains used as restraint were clearly inadequate for the task in hand. No reliance should have been placed on the parking brake as a means of restraint and chocks should have been used to provide greater load safety. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[48] I find it strange that notwithstanding the guilty pleas tendered before the High Court of Justiciary by both the driver, Mr MacLennan, and the company for contraventions of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, Mr William Munro for the company still thought that their procedures were acceptable and Mr MacLennan, on examination, spoke of doing his job as he had always done. Neither seemed to appreciate that their failings might have contributed to the accident and put the reason for the accident down purely to a defective parking brake system. The clear evidence, however, before the court was that a parking brake system was only to be considered as a bonus to a system of load restraint and it appears clear that the company and driver's ignorance of the Code of Practice in relation to the loading of vehicles contributed to the resulting tragedy. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[49] I have no doubt that Mr MacLennan was a very experienced driver and his employers had a great confidence in him. Nonetheless it seems strange that they allow drivers to transport heavy and dangerous loads without having to demonstrate any qualification or competence in the loading and securing of such loads. Mr Munro indicated that his company relied on the drivers' experience and Mr MacLennan, the driver, spoke of basically being left to find out for himself. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[50] Mr Norton spoke of such a problem not simply relating to the present case but being replicated throughout the haulage industry so that a new driver with no training or experience would be qualified to transport heavy goods simply by having passed a HGV driving test which concentrated on his control of the vehicle. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[51] I accept that Council Directive 2003/59/EC have taken effect through the Vehicle Drivers (Certificates of Professional Competence) Regulation 2007 which came into force on 11<sup>th</sup> September 2009 but these Regulations only apply to new drivers and therefore the vast majority of drivers do not become subject to compulsory periodic training until 10<sup>th</sup> September 2014, a delay which to me seems a matter of serious concern as far as safety of the public is concerned. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[52] I also consider that every load should be accurately weighed before being transported. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>[53] So far as chains and other load restraint equipment is concerned, I would respectfully suggest that such equipment should be part of a register showing safe working load and dates of inspection.
