Crops were mainly for feed. Normally the deceased worked by himself. His mother provided some assistance as did his son Gavin who worked with a local firm of agricultural engineers as an apprentice mechanic.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

It was normal practice for the deceased to maintain the equipment used on the 2 farms. Included in the inventory of equipment was a Krone KR 130B baler which was manufactured in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Germany</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'> in 1993. According to the deceased's son this had been acquired second hand around 15 years ago. The baler is about 3.7 metres long 2.29 metres wide and 2.09 metres high. It is designed to be towed behind a tractor. A pick up roller with tines at the front of the baler picks up cut material (straw or hay). An internal chain driven conveyor of metal slats forces that material to form a round bale which can then be tied or wrapped to hold it together before being ejected from the rear and falling on to the ground. This is achieved by raising the tailgate of the baler. The Health and Safety inspectors discovered that this tailgate weighed in the order of 390kg. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

The deceased's son thought that it would have been acquired second hand about 25 years ago. This was not used with the baler when it was baling as although it was equipped with a normal power take off, it was not equipped with the 3 hydraulic supplies that would have been necessary to fully operate the baler in the field. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

No defects were found that could have contributed to the accident leading to the death of James Fraser.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

This was usually done at the end of the season, in preparation for the next growing season. However it had not been done immediately after the end of the previous season and Gavin was aware that his father proposed to take advantage of the need to move the baler to another shed to carry out the maintenance on the day of the accident.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

To access the interior of the baler where the parts requiring lubrication are necessitates the raising of the tailgate. The procedure Gavin expected that his father would follow would be to open the tailgate using the hydraulic control in the tractor cab, 'lock' the tailgate in that position using a hydraulic lock-off (or isolation) lever, return to the cab, retard the hydraulic control for the rams, then using a compressor spray oil on to the interior of the baler with the conveyor mechanism running. This would necessitate his father leaning into the baler from the rear with the power take off shaft of the tractor turning and supplying mechanical power to the conveyor slat drive chains. Having the mechanism running speeds up the job of lubrication.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Hydraulic fluid is pumped under pressure through an entry port at the bottom of the chamber of the ram which contains a piston. This pushes the piston up towards the top of the chamber, extending the piston rod which is attached to the tailgate which in turn rises opening the tail of the baler through which a bale is ejected or access can be obtained to clean and maintain the interior workings.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

In normal operation these operations are controlled from within the tractor unit to which the baler is connected. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Firstly there is an isolation valve at the base of the left hand (looking from the rear) or nearside hydraulic cylinder. It is a simple lever which moves downwards from the horizontal closed position to the vertical open position. In the former position hydraulic fluid is effectively trapped in the chamber of the ram and cannot flow back to the fluid reservoir, thus maintaining hydraulic pressure. This isolation valve does not prevent the fluid in the right hand ram dropping in pressure.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

The 'oil can' would have been connected to the hose from the compressor, allowing the oil to be sprayed onto the surface to be lubricated.

Unfortunately the specialist was delayed because of transport difficulties so that when Ms Poyner was back in Orkney the specialist was not initially available.

The specialist (Mr Wilson) then arrived the following day and carried out his examination of the equipment. Ms Poyner and the agricultural specialist also attended. The specialist subsequently continued enquiries with the manufacturers of the baler and prepared a report recording his findings and opinion as to how the accident was likely to have occurred.

I am satisfied that nothing turned on the instructions and warnings contained in the manual or on the notices ('decals') affixed to the baler as the deceased was clearly aware of the function of the scotches. I was told that he used them (or at least one of them) if his younger son was working on the equipment even though he did not use them if he was on his own. Nor did his son Gavin use them (although he would now). On each of the hydraulic rams there were 2 decals. The lower of these was a diagrammatic warning not to work under the raised tailgate unless the isolation lever had been closed or locked (that is raised to the horizontal). The upper decal consisted of a red outlined warning triangle surrounding an exclamation mark all on a yellow background with the following wording - "ATTENTION INSALL HYD. - RAMSTOP". Being the specialist Mr Wilson appears to have had no difficulty in understanding that this last warning was intended to indicate that the mechanical supports or scotches should be used in addition to the hydraulic shut-off.

I was also told by Ms Poyner that in her view, although the safety regime in place at the time of manufacture of this baler was different the baler would meet current safety requirements, which do not require a secondary support system in the form of scotches. Indeed the fact that the isolation lever is located so close to the hydraulic ram means that the possibilities for defects down the hydraulic line from the ram affecting its operation are reduced. In fairness Ms Poyner did indicate that although modern balers might rely on a hydraulic isolation switch as their primary safety system, the possibilities of inadvertent operation of the lever have been reduced with the need for positive disengagement to move the lever from its "locked" position. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>Post Mortem Examination</span></i></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

There were only two significant external injuries noted namely a parchmented abrasion (17 x 8.5 cm) over the upper sternum / lower midline of the front of the neck which extended to the right upper chest area; and a second similar type abrasion (28.5 x 4 cm) extending diagonally across the upper back from the left shoulder to the right lower scapula border.

The control lever on the tractor had been in the down position sufficiently far to stop the hydraulic pump from pumping against hydraulic pressure. The isolation lever was inadvertently moved from the closed (horizontal position) allowing the tailgate to drop unexpectedly when the deceased would have been unaware what was happening because of the dim lighting and the noise of the tractor engine, power take off, conveyor mechanism and the compressor. The isolation valve lever could have been snagged on the compressed air hose or a piece of the deceased's clothing.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

It is no comfort to those who have lost a father, husband, son and friend in Mr Fraser's death that I recognise that the benefit of hindsight makes it quite clear that Mr Fraser should have used the scotch or scotches with which the baler was provided. Had he recognised that if the hydraulic stop failed there was no secondary safety system in place, as he did when he was responsible for the safety of his younger son, then the accident would not have happened. Ms Poyner recognised that particularly in the agricultural industry where so many are self employed and used to working on their own there is a tendency to take risks with one's own health and safety that one would not take with another's (whether employee or relative). Mr Fraser would have carried out the same operation in the same way numerous times before without the lever being snagged and therefore without the risk having been highlighted. As Ms Poyner eloquently put it the fact that nothing adverse had happened in the past acted as positive reinforcement of bad practice, by which I understood that having done the job this way in the past he would not have thought about the risks before starting it this day.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>Lessons.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

It may well be that had he been working in a less confined space, that is had there been more space around the baler the isolation lever might not have been moved inadvertently but no one criticised the method of work as inherently dangerous and it seems to me that the accident could have occurred even with more space around the baler. I am not satisfied that the deceased having taken the precaution of not running the conveyor mechanism would have avoided the accident. With the reduction in noise he may have heard something as the tailgate started to fall, although Ms Poyner's evidence that very little noise at most was produced tends to negate that. If he had been working in a better lit area and not relying on a head-torch then it is possible that he may have noticed the tailgate moving. Whether if he had heard or seen such evidence of movement he would have been able to do anything to avoid being trapped is speculation but all the evidence points to this having happened quickly. It may be some limited comfort to the family that I have concluded that he did not know what was happening.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Ms Poyner gave evidence about 2 freely available publications. The first is Agricultural Information Sheet No. 4 titled "Safe use of big round balers". Although Ms Poyner was unsure of the publication date the leaflet says that it was reprinted and redesigned in 2007. It refers to HSE having investigated 36 accidents involving balers in the previous 10 years, including 5 fatal accidents. In the 'to do list' farmers are advised to "use the tailgate ram prop when working under the rear door". The second leaflet is a farm machinery safety step-by-step guide titled "No Second Chances". The guidance is said to be based on an analysis of 1000 agricultural accidents involving maintenance and blockage clearing. I was told that a video accompanies it. On the pre maintenance advice "Before you start", securing anything which could move is highlighted with advice to "use appropriate props, chocks, etc (eg prop a raised trailer body". Both publications suggest, as does the baler instruction manual, not to have equipment running whist working on it.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

I was told that there had been a practice up to 2007 of carrying out random inspections of farms to look at practices before an accident, but that now inspections are only carried out if there is a specific need identified.

I accepted her submission that although it would have been good practice to do so, in this case the fact that the engine of the tractor, the power take-off and the baler conveyor were not halted when Mr Fraser was working on the baler had no material impact on this accident and could not be said to be a defect in the system of working that would. Given that there was evidence that not using scotches was normal practice, Ms Foard invited me to find that this was a defect in the system of work which contributed to the accident. I did not do so in those precise terms but took the view that the real issue was the failure to assess and identify that risk. It was suggested that I might find that working in such limited visibility might be seen as a defect in the system of work, but for the reasons outlined I was not persuaded that this contributed to the accident and did not make any finding as suggested.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p></div></body></html>
