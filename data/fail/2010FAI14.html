There are different sizes of police cell vans and the van at Cumbernauld was larger than that which came from Airdrie.&nbsp; The Airdrie van (Reg No&nbsp; SF04&nbsp; FGD) was one of a number of similar vans used by Strathclyde Police.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had two rows of seats at the front which could be entered through front or rear doors on both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the rear seats were two police riot shields made of a Perspex material.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front portion of the van was separated from the rear by a number of bars which allowed anybody in the front to hear and communicate with a prisoner in the rear or vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp; On either side of the rear partition there was a bench like area facing inwards and the bars extended down to the level of the bench like seats in relation to the area covered by the seats.&nbsp;&nbsp; The central portion consisted partly of a solid white partition which extended from the floor for a distance above the level of the seats and by bars similar to those on either side to the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The height of the white solid partition between the ends of the seats was approximately twice the height of the seats and approximately half the height of the van.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear area of the van is sufficiently low that it is impossible to stand up in it without stooping.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the rear of this prisoner area there is a door with bars reaching to the floor which was shut once a prisoner was in and immediately behind that door were the back &nbsp;doors of the van which again were shut during transit.&nbsp;

They decided to, and did, place him on the floor of the van with his back to the partition wedged by his bulk between the two bench like seats with his head and shoulders above the level of the top of the partition.&nbsp;

Both the Fiscal and the representative of the Chief Constable asked me to find that the cause of death was "unascertained" in accordance with the findings of Dr Clark and Dr Iles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They contended that Professor Busuttil's evidence supported this view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Thomson argued that I could find that the cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia contributed to by a number of factors including the presence of a large quantity of alcohol, a history of hypotension, cardiac scarring, acute agitation and confusion, a degree of mild and non-fatal positional asphyxia and the presence of Tranadol in the blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I have indicated, it is necessary for me to make a finding based on the balance of probabilities.&nbsp; Having considered all the evidence and, in particular, the detailed findings made at post mortem and the evidence of Dr Clark who conducted the post mortem and therefore was able to see if there were any signs which would give a clue to a probable cause of death,&nbsp; there is an insufficient weight of evidence to make a finding based on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; Accordingly I must find that the cause of death is unascertained.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of Section 6(1)(c) the Fiscal invited me to find that nothing had occurred up to the point where a decision was made to move Mr Mitchell to Monklands Hospital which would give any ground for suggesting that there was a reasonable precaution whereby the death might have been avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She contended, and I agree, that the actions of the police officers at </span><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Burns Road</span><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'> and those of the ambulance personnel who attended there cannot, under any circumstances, be criticised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Mitchell was a very drunk, abusive and aggressive man and was totally unco-operative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constables Laybourne and MacDonald did what they could to get him to the ambulance and to supervise him there while he was examined by qualified ambulance personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of Mr Mitchell's repeated and persistent refusal to accept the advice that he should go to hospital (even if it was not in the opinion of the ambulance personnel necessary) it was appropriate for the police officers to arrest him, as they did.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision to transport him in a car to the police station and his treatment in the police station did nothing to contribute to his death and cannot in any circumstances be criticised.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, Sergeant Brown's decision that medical opinion should be obtained before he was detained in a cell was entirely appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duty sergeant has a responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of prisoners in his care and while it may have been purely precautionary to obtain such an opinion, Sergeant Brown was perfectly entitled, and it was equally appropriate, that such an opinion should be obtained before Mr Mitchell was put into a police cell when he could not be observed constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fiscal invited me to consider whether a finding under Section 6(1)(c) could be made to the effect that had Mr Mitchell been observed constantly by a police officer during the journey from Cumbernauld to Monklands Hospital the change in his condition might have been spotted more quickly and appropriate steps taken to deal with that thereby preventing the death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson supported this argument emphasising that sub-section (c) uses the word "might."&nbsp; He contended therefore that I did not need to find matters proved to the same standard as is required in relation the other sub-sections.&nbsp; In particular, Mr Thomson emphasised that even if the cause of death remained as "unascertained" it would be possible to speculate that no matter what the cause of death it "might" have been avoided had immediate steps been taken to get Mr Mitchell help as soon as his condition changed in the back of the van. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept that there is some basis for the argument that Mr Mitchell was not as closely supervised during the journey as he might have been.&nbsp; In retrospect Constable Bowman accepted this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Constable Duffy was driving the vehicle and could not be expected to undertake this task but Constable Bowman could have been expected to ensure that he was aware of Mr Mitchell's wellbeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to this he spoke to him on two occasions but received no response, (something which did not surprise him as he was aware that prisoners often did not speak to police officers in the course of a journey) and he observed him by raising himself from the seat of the van and looking backwards on two occasions.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Mitchell had been placed in the van by Constables Laybourne and MacDonald.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had left him in a position whereby his head and shoulders were above the solid division part which separated the back from the front of the van.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was therefore in a position where he could be observed by Constable Bowman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, as I do, I accept the evidence of Constable Bowman that on the two occasions on which he turned to look at Mr Mitchell that he could observe his head and shoulders I require to conclude that on the last occasion when he did that observation Mr Mitchell's condition had not changed to the extent that he had slumped down to the position he was found in by Constable Laybourne when the vehicle arrived at Monklands Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson argued that such a finding could not be made because Constable Bowman had not checked the position of Mr Mitchell before the journey started and accordingly it was possible that he had slumped down while the vehicle was travelling between Cumbernauld Police Office and the A73.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not accept this argument as it is not consistent with the evidence given by Constable Laybourne as to the position in which she had left Mr Mitchell when she had placed him in the van and the position she found him in when she opened the doors at the hospital.&nbsp; When she placed him in the van at Cumbernauld his head was up.&nbsp; When she saw him in opening the door at Monklands his chin was against his chest and he had slipped down the partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he been in that position before Constable Bowman observed him while the van was on the A73 then Constable Bowman would not have seen Mr Mitchell's head and shoulders in a normal position as he indicated he did.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is even unclear whether if Mr Mitchell had slumped down before the first observation that Constable Bowman could have seen his shoulders at all as they may well have been below the level of the top of the solid partition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no directive or other instructions to police officers in relation to the placing of prisoners in the back of cell vans nor was there specific instruction that they required to be observed and spoken to constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following Mr Mitchell's death such an instruction has now been issued and I am satisfied that its terms are clear and should be followed in future &nbsp;by all police officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It therefore follows that in the absence of such a document in December 2008 and based on the evidence of Sergeant Brown, DI Rule and Constable Laybourne that it was accepted that people could be placed in the back of a cell van on the floor because of their drunken condition and the potential danger to themselves, that the decision to put Mr Mitchell in that position cannot be criticised.&nbsp; It would not be a reasonable precaution in December 2008 to have put him in a different position nor is there any evidence to suggest that that would have saved his life.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>There therefore remains the question as to whether had Constable Bowman kept Mr Mitchell under constant observation or had he checked him between the last time he did so within the Burgh of Airdrie and the arrival at Monklands Hospital whether that might have prevented the death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have reached the conclusion that it would not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Constable Bowman observed that Mr Mitchell had slumped down it would have been possible to stop the police vehicle immediately to ascertain the cause of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On reaching the inside of the vehicle Constables Duffy and Bowman would have realised that Mr Mitchell's condition had worsened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they did not have a defibulator or anything other than basic first aid equipment they could either have sent for urgent medical help or alternatively resumed their journey at high speed to the hospital.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had they waited for medical help from the hospital then the resulting delay would have resulted in more time passing than in fact did occur in this case by them travelling normally to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had they resumed their journey and travelled at high speed to the hospital the time spent in ascertaining Mr Mitchell's condition and then resuming the short journey from the top half of Airdrie to the hospital would probably have been longer than the original journey and most certainly would not have been shorter.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; have accordingly reached the conclusion that once I have accepted that the change in Mr Mitchell's condition occurred between the time he was last observed by Constable Bowman between the Rawyards Roundabout and the Top Cross that there was no reasonable precaution whereby the death might have been avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it could be argued that a reasonable precaution would have been to observe Mr Mitchell more rigorously there was no instruction for a police officer to do so.&nbsp; Furthermore I am satisfied that even with such intense observation the time space between the change in Mr Mitchell's condition and his arrival at hospital is sufficiently short, that it cannot be stated even on the wide scope &nbsp;allowed by sub-section (c) that the death might have been avoided.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Thomson was critical of the decision to use the small cell van but I am satisfied by the evidence that this was a normal vehicle used on many occasions by Strathclyde Police and that as it was the vehicle available it was appropriate that it be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Thomson was also critical of the decision not to arrange for Mr Mitchell's transfer by ambulance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would, he contended, have therefore been available all the appropriate emergency equipment to dealt with Mr Mitchell's collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, there was no justification whatsoever for calling an ambulance and it would have been totally inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambulances are intended to deal with genuine emergencies, not to act as a taxi service to the hospital when&nbsp; there are limited ambulance resources available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two ambulances based in Cumbernauld and they required to be available to deal with any emergency that might arise and also to provide cover for other areas if the need arose.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was absolutely no justification for diverting an ambulance from its normal duties for more than half an hour in order to transfer Mr Mitchell from Cumbernauld Police Office to the hospital particularly when the decision to take him to hospital was merely to obtain&nbsp; a precautionary medical opinion.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson was critical of Constables Laybourne and MacDonald in their decision to put Mr Mitchell in the position they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it to Constable Laybourne that she had "shown a disregard for her prisoner's safety."&nbsp; This suggestion, which clearly upset Constable Laybourne, was, in my view, totally unjustified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constable Laybourne, in particular, and Constable MacDonald displayed, in my view, every possible care and attention for the welfare of their prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They carefully considered the various options and had regard to his drunken condition and their fear for his safety if he was placed on the bench.&nbsp; They accordingly chose to put him in &nbsp;what they regarded as the safest possible position, wedged between the two benches because of his size and in as comfy a position as possible with his legs in a "W" position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I considered that the two officers are to be commended for their standard of care towards Mr Mitchell and that no criticism whatsoever can be directed at them and I therefore reject Mr Thomson's suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also satisfied that the existence of the new directive in relation to the transporting of prisoners in cell vans is an appropriate reaction to this tragic death but should not under any circumstance be taken as an indication that the system which existed in relation to the placing of a prisoner in such a position was inappropriate at December 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider that passage which requires officers to ensure that they have visual and other contact with the prisoner is appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Had it been in force in December &nbsp;2008 it would however not have altered the tragic outcome because of the timescales involved between the time that Mr Mitchell's condition did not give cause for concern, his apparent collapse and his arrival at the hospital.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>In relation to Section 6(1)(d) the Fiscal suggested that I make no finding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sub-section (c) allows a Court to consider what "might" have caused the death to be avoided whereas sub-section (d) acquires an affirmative finding that a defect in the system of work existed and that that defect contributed to the death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>The representative of the Chief Constable supported this view contending firstly that there had not been any defects in any system of working and that furthermore even if I found that there had been any defects they had not contributed to the death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>In support of this new point, both Mrs McGarrity and Miss Ali submitted that the police officers had correctly arrested Mr Mitchell as he was drunk and incapable, that they were correct in their use of handcuffs to restrain him, that Sergeant Brown was entitled to seek medical confirmation that Mr Mitchell could be detained in a cell, and therefore it was appropriate that he should send Mr Mitchell to Monklands District General Hospital and that Constables MacDonald and Laybourne had placed Mr Mitchell in what was considered to be the safest possible position because of his intoxicated state and in order to prevent him falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officers had acted in accordance with the Police Standard Operating Procedures and in accordance with what was accepted practice by a number of experienced officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, there was no evidence to suggest that had matters been dealt with in any different way they could be shown on a balance of probabilities that the death could have been avoided.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson argued that I should make a finding in terms of sub-section (d).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggested that Mr Mitchell's medical history, which was available on the police computer records, should have been communicated to the officers who were dealing with him directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not accept this argument for two reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I am not clear that there was anything in the records which would have altered the way in which Mr Mitchell was dealt with even if it had been known (the information was general and limited).&nbsp; Secondly, I am not satisfied that even Sergeant Brown had the necessary information available to him before Mr Mitchell left Cumbernauld Police Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson also argued that Sergeant Brown should have made enquiry about the availability of an ambulance or other police vehicle to transport Mr Mitchell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It would have been totally inappropriate to take Mr Mitchell in the back of a police car because of his aggressive behaviour and the potential danger to police officers in the course of the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time that it took for the van to come from Coatbridge Mr Mitchell was under constant supervision and observation by Constables Laybourne and MacDonald and there is, in my view, no grounds for suggesting that that delay was not entirely appropriate nor that it, in any way, was a factor which is relevant to Mr Mitchell's death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>A further point raised by Mr Thomson was that the issue of supervision of Mr Mitchell was not discussed between Constables Laybourne and MacDonald on the one hand and Constables Duffy and Bowman on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not consider that there is any substance in this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constables Laybourne and MacDonald appreciated that they had a responsibility to place Mr Mitchell in the best possible position taking into consideration all the relevant factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constables Duffy and Bowman knew that they had a responsibility to transport Mr Mitchell to the hospital and Constable Bowman knew that he had a responsibility to observe Mr Mitchell and he did so.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not see any purpose would have been served by discussion between the four officers before the journey started.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Mr Thomson's final point under this sub-section was that officers should receive specific training on the positioning of an accused within police vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I do not consider that this is relevant to this death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it was very clear that Constables Laybourne and MacDonald had given very careful and thorough consideration of what position Mr Mitchell should be placed in the back of the van.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were following the procedure which Constable Laybourne had seen before, which Constable Duffy had also seen before and which other even more experienced officers accepted took place before December 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issuing of the new procedure from March 2009 has now clarified the need to ensure that a prisoner is kept under observation and is communicated with and, in particular, that a person should not be placed on the floor of a cell van.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe that there is any evidence that the placing of Mr Mitchell on the floor of the cell van has been shown on a balance of probabilities to cause or contributed to his death, the cause of which is "unascertained."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally, for the reasons which I have given I am satisfied that there is no evidence to the appropriate standard to show that Constable Bowman's limited observation (in the sense that he only turned twice to check Mr Mitchell in the course of the journey) was a relevant factor to his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepting, as I do, the evidence of Constable Laybourne in relation to the position in which she and Constable MacDonald placed Mr Mitchell at the start of the journey and her evidence as to his changed position when she opened the van doors at Monklands Hospital, I have to conclude that the change in Mr Mitchell's position and condition occurred during the short period while the van was travelling within the Burgh of Airdrie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The fact that he clearly was a chronic alcoholic whose drinking habits had started as a teenager are, in my view, not relevant to his death as it was his condition and behaviour on the particular night which were the factors which led to the circumstances of that evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think it would be unfair for Mr Mitchell's relatives to include such a finding in the formal Determination which may then be passed to the Registrar with a view to clarifying particulars on a Death Certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This has been a very anxious Inquiry for Mr Mitchell's relatives but it has also been an anxious Inquiry for certain Police Officers and it is important they, and particularly Constables Laybourne and MacDonald, appreciate that, in my view, the evidence established that they had acted in a sympathetic, competent and professional manner throughout their dealings with Mr Mitchell.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>For the relatives of Mr Mitchell I can only repeat what I stated in the Court at the end of the hearing that they have the Court's deepest sympathy in their sad loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mitchell was a popular person and his very sudden death, around Christmas time, must have been a particular blow to all who knew and loved him.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>A major burden of presenting the evidence in this case fell upon Mrs McGarrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The care and thoroughness with which she had investigated and researched the evidence and the manner in which she presented it to the Court cannot be faulted in any way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that everybody involved in the Inquiry will be grateful to her for the hard work which she had put in;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I certainly am as it assisted me considerably in considering numerous facets which arose in the course of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mr Thomson and Miss Ali presented the respective interests in respect of which they had been instructed in a thoroughly professional and competent manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand in relation to all three that this was their first Fatal Accident Inquiry and if that is indeed so then the standard of presentation and argument was quite exceptional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
