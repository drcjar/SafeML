He had been there from </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> until his death on 20<sup>th</sup>/</span><span lang=EN-GB>21<sup>st</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Around </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB> on 20<sup>th</sup>/21<sup>st</sup> July 2009 B hanged himself in his secure bedroom by means of a ligature formed from his dressing gown using the gap between the door and the door frame of the en suite facility as the ligature point. He was discovered at that time as a result of a routine check on him. It is likely that the action of hanging himself caused an immediate cardiac arrest and that death would have occurred almost immediately. For this reason any attempt by B to reverse his own actions would not have been possible. It was unlikely in the circumstances that an attempt to resuscitate him would have succeeded. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It has not been established why B acted in the way he did as there were no signs during his time at Kibble, including near the time of his death that he would consider acting in the way he did. Accordingly, it has not been established that B intended to kill himself. In the past, B had shown impulsive and attention seeking behaviour including threats of self harm, but it has not been established, either, that B's action on the evening of 20<sup>th</sup> July 2009 was an act of impulsive or attention seeking behaviour or of deliberate self harm.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Various issues were raised at the Inquiry. In terms of the practices in place at Kibble, B should not have been left with his dressing gown in his bedroom overnight and its removal was overlooked. It could have been removed by Kibble staff. B had pyjamas and bedding within his room which could have been used to form a ligature had he wished. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>B should have been checked that he had settled in his bedroom every fifteen minutes from bedtime until </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and that could have been done. The checking on that evening was of a lesser frequency. It would have been a matter of chance, had the fifteen minute regime been operated, that B's actions would have been discovered before they were. It would have been a matter of chance that the operation of the fifteen minute inspection would have prevented B's death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>B's self harm and threats of self harm, in the nature of impulsive and attention seeking behaviour, although historic in context, could and should have been communicated by B's social worker to the staff at Kibble. It would have been normal to have done so, on B's first arrival at Kibble. On that day, both B's social worker and his keyworker at Kibble were on leave and therefore not present and the matter was overlooked thereafter. On the evidence, knowledge of B's history would not have affected the regime applicable to him for night time monitoring on </span><span lang=EN-GB>20th July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Along with the other young persons in Kibble, B was already closely monitored.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>An item was found half concealed in B's pillow as a result of a routine inspection on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> May 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> which was thought to be a model ligature. The find was assessed and steps were taken as a precaution to monitor B more closely as a result of the find. The manner of assessment of the find lacked structure but even if a decision had been taken for additional measures of supervision, it is likely such measures would have been removed before </span><span lang=EN-GB>20<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. That would have been so even if the staff at Kibble had been aware of B's previous history. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>CPR had been stopped before the ambulance team arrived, contrary to Kibble policy, but had CPR continued it would have made no difference to the outcome.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There were systems in place at the time of B's death.

It gave directions and made recommendations relating to the operation of Kibble in light of circumstances of the death of B. Kibble has implemented these. These have improved the operating procedures at Kibble. The issue of effective communication between social workers and care establishments for young persons has been addressed nationally subsequent to July 2009 by the alteration of the requirements of the information to be provided, and the forms of written reporting have been altered by the introduction of a history of the young person known as a chronology.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff finds in fact:-<b><u> </u></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=1 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>B was a thirteen year old boy at the time of his death.

He had been subject to the intervention of South Lanarkshire Council Social Work Department and subject to supervision requirements in terms of the Children (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>) Act 1995. These requirements had him reside, at times, with his grandparents, in Bardykes and Hillhouse homes and in the secure unit of Kenmure St Mary's home, a total of eight placements since being accommodated in November 2007. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=2 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>As a result of a fire raising incident, a children's hearing granted a warrant that B reside again in a secure unit.

The educational component of the school comes under the scrutiny of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Education and for registration purposes it is an independent school. It is inspected twice per year by the Care Commission. It has a good regulatory history, with no formal complaints or enforcement action but was subject to certain requirements and recommendations of the Care Commission following the inspection carried out by the Care Commission and reported on </span><span lang=EN-GB>7<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=6 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There are compendious guiding policies and standard operating procedures formulated in writing by the management of Kibble, and approved for the operation of Kibble. These included guidance in connection with recognising suicidal ideation and self harm. The staff were required to familiarise themselves with these and did so. Staff at Kibble also received training for the purpose of carrying out their functions at Kibble.

One such practice related to the night shift. It was to the effect that the young persons in the Safe Centre would be checked every fifteen minutes from being placed for the night in their bedrooms until </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB> and hourly thereafter. If a young person was not asleep at </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB>, observations were to be maintained at fifteen minute intervals until the young person was seen to be asleep.

Barra has communal rooms and offices. The unit has access to secure shared facilities such as a gym, swimming pool, and outside recreational areas. There are six secure bedrooms for single occupancy in Barra unit, and an observation secure bedroom. Each bedroom has a built in bed with normal bedding and an en suite facility containing toilet, wash basin and shower. In July 2009 and currently the access to each of the six bedrooms from the bedroom corridor was and is by a door which can be locked both electronically and by conventional key lock. There is outside each bedroom, built into the outside wall of the bedroom, a secure panel accessed from the corridor by staff using an electronic key. Part of the panel contains a six inch by three inch observation window which can be opened by the staff member to observe the occupant of the bedroom. This allows staff to monitor the occupant of the room. The panel also has controls for the supply to the room of water lighting and power. Any opening of a bedroom door and any opening of a monitoring window to any bedroom is electronically recorded. The fob to open the observation windows has a unique electronic number and that unique number is allocated to a carer on receipt of the fob. By that means the identity of the carer carrying out monitoring or accessing tasks can be readily identified. The observation secure bedroom was not and is not located within the bedroom corridor.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=10 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Prior to B's death, there was an internal door access between the en suite facility and the bedroom in each bedroom in Barra. That door could be locked back by staff into a frame set into the wall of the bedroom in an open position so that it became flush with the wall. There remained a small gap between the door and the door frame around the door when the door was locked against the wall. The door and its housing had been supplied as an entire unit from suppliers during the construction on the Safe Centre.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=11 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The corridor to the bedrooms is covered by an internal CCTV system.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=12 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The bedrooms were designed to contain anti suicide features including the elimination of ligature points. Prior to commissioning, the Safe Centre building had been inspected by representatives of the Care Commission and an architect commissioned by the Scottish Government. Following on that inspection in 2007 the Safe Centre was approved for occupation as a secure unit for the accommodation of young persons. As subsequent events showed, the gap between the door and the door frame when the en suite door was locked in an open position, formed a possible ligature point.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=13 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>In July 2009 and subsequently, each occupant of the bedrooms in Barra had a cupboard outside his room in the nature of a locker, which contained his belongings including all his clothing including night wear. The locker was kept locked and access to it was controlled by staff members who opened and shut it as required, and access to the locker was always in the presence of a member of staff. Young persons occupying the rooms were allowed various personal and other items in their rooms, such as a television, books, papers, writing materials.

A matter of note is that B had behaved badly on two consecutive nights and on the second night, notwithstanding that all was said to have been resolved, B was left with his dressing gown when he should not have been. The explanation of Mr Morton about whose responsibility for seeing to it that the dressing gown was put in the locker; he saying that it was up to B to do so, not that it was his responsibility to see that it was done, was not convincing.

Ms McGrory gave clear evidence, not cross examined, that when she entered room six for the first time and in a state of shock she had asked Mr Scott when he had last checked B. According to her, Mr Scott had replied, fifteen minutes ago. Clearly, that was not correct. This was not put to Mr Scott who gave evidence first. Ms McGrory also gave evidence that Mr. Scott said that when seen earlier B had been reading, not that he had been sleeping, but that he had been reading.

His position was that B had been reading at 21.57 hours, had been apparently sleeping at 22.46 hours, and again apparently sleeping at 23.14 hours. In that event, it is unexplained why he would feel the need to tell Ms McGrory inaccurately that the observation was last done fifteen minutes before, when according to his evidence there was no need for him to do fifteen minute checks because B was asleep.

The CCTV does not show what was going on in the room but it shows the arrival of Mr. Scott, of him entering room six and the night manager Ms McGrory and her comings and goings, the arrival of Ms Emma Faulds<b> </b>and the arrival of the ambulance team.

There was then a gap of time before the ambulance team entered the corridor and room six at 00.19 hours.

I did not hear from the police officers at the scene. It would have been helpful to have heard that evidence. I did not see the dressing gown and neither cord not belt was produced. As noted, there was conflicting evidence about whether dressing gowns used by the young person had cords or short fasteners. The preponderance of the evidence supported the existence of full dressing gown cords or belts having been attached to at least some of the dressing gowns at the time of B's death. No one could remember if B's dressing gown had a cord. The photographs do not appear to show a cord. The fact that B in those photographs is not wearing his dressing gown but that it is in close proximity to his body may be an indicator. The evidence of the pathologist, if anything, tends to point away from the more defined mark that a cord might make in that the evidence of the ligature mark was suggestive of a wider piece of material. I consider that the word "cord" is unlikely to be used to describe a fastener in the form of a wider belt of the same material as the dressing gown, but that, too, is speculative.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB>The ambulance service </span></u></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The evidence was that the ambulance containing the paramedic, Mr. Fallow arrived at Kibble in four minutes from the call being made from Kibble.

None of the threats by B had been carried out; there was no evidence that B put himself in harm's way by standing in front of motor vehicles other than the motor cycle (and the circumstances of that incident were not explored in evidence).

In a structured formal assessment it may have been the case that the person carrying out the assessment would have raised the issue of self harm and suicidal ideation and of ligatures in past history specifically. In that event Mr Meechan may have been asked specific questions about self harm and suicidal ideation and ligatures. Had he been asked specifically it is likely that he would have mentioned the history. There would have been several possible elements to such an assessment; self harm, suicidal ideation, a possible interest in, a fascination for, an obsession with ligatures, a propensity to (a) threaten self harm without following through, (b) to wind up the carers, (c) impulsive behaviour, (d) attention seeking behaviour. In the event, Mr Meechan, Mr Walker and Ms McGeown each knew of the ligature find yet, on the evidence, did not think to pursue the matter.

As I understood her, B was less depressed that might have been expected of him. Certainly, her later reports did not refer to B being depressed.

Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to make the determination set out by the procurator fiscal.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Scott's position was that he had not done regular fifteen minute checks for some time and he had no need to do so as regards B. If that was so, had there been a system of monitoring the electronic information, that situation would have come to light. I have set out above why I am not in a position to hold it established Mr Scott had been using a different monitoring regime.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>However, had a monitoring regime been in place and had it had the result that Mr Scott was monitoring every fifteen minutes up to </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB>, for the reasons set out above, the absence of such as system could not be said to have contributed to the death of B. That is because it is speculation to suggest that the fifteen minute inspections would made any difference. In such circumstances, the absence of monitoring the observation system cannot be said to have contributed to the death of B.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>In submission, there was touched on a proposition that if the inspections had been less frequent and known to be so by the occupants in the rooms, that knowledge could have been used for B's preparations.

I agree that it is not an issue. Of course, had there been no ligature point at the locked door, that point could not have been used as a ligature point. Had no other ligature point been identified by B then he would not have had the means to proceed in the way he did. The locked door as a ligature point had not been identified as a danger. The fact that the door has now been removed altogether does not mean that it should not have been there from the start. The need to give the young persons in the Safe Centre privacy and whether the issue of the gap in the door should have been addressed was not really explored. All that can be said is that it was not considered an issue at the time and there is no evidence to suggest that it should have been seen earlier.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The procurator fiscal made no submissions as regards the nature of communication between South Lanarkshire Council Social Work Department and Kibble. In particular the matter of self harm and suicidal ideation was not the subject of submission. The procurator fiscal did not suggest that there had been a defect in the system as regards the assessment of B at stages in Kibble.

On the findings set out above, I consider that it would be speculative to suggest that the absence of the information about the incidents and the family history had a part to play in the death of B. As already said, the young persons including B were the subject of round the clock daily ongoing scrutiny and assessment by trained carers who were trained to observe patterns of behaviour. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The procurator fiscal made no submissions as regards other circumstances.
