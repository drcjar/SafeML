When giving evidence she was referred to the SIGN Guidelines which lay down the parameters for children presenting out of hours. Mrs Satha told her of the noises, which had settled at examination. She carried out a head to toe examination of the child. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> was a well looked after child. There were no signs of respiratory problems. She recorded his heart rate and listened into the three zones of his chest. He had good muscle tone and handled well. He was breast feeding well during day and night. His respiratory rate and heart rate were all within the normal parameters for a child of his age. His oxygen circulation was excellent at 99 per cent. There were none of the warning signals such as poor feeding, lethargy, history of stopping breathing, poor respiratory rate or chest wall recession, where a child was struggling for breath. Mrs Mathieson noted that </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> had been prescribed nasal drops by the health visitor and took no issue with this. Mrs Satha was told to watch for changes in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>. At the time, she was relieved with what she had been told by Mrs Mathieson. In her evidence she said that she thought that if she had been worried enough to take Zion up to the hospital in the middle of the night, that her concerns about a link between Zion's condition and that of his elder brother should have been taken more seriously. She also said that only </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
  12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>'s elder brother's record appeared on Mrs Mathieson's computer. Mrs Mathieson said that she did not recall being told about </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s elder brother being hospitalised. His name had not come up on her computer as she recalled. She would have taken family history into consideration but from her examination of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> and taking account of Dr Gibson's comments below about respiratory problems being quite common amongst young children, I do not believe such history would have affected her conclusion. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:

  line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>. She had looked at </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
  12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>'s colour, posture, breathing and temperature. He said that a monitoring of oxygen levels in the blood of mid 90s per cent or higher is good. In </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s case it was 99 per cent. He placed emphasis on whether </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
  12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'> was feeding properly. It was noted that he was. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> was not using his accessory muscles along the chest wall and neck which are obviously being used by a child with respiratory difficulties but not obvious in a child, who was breathing quietly and normally. Mrs Mathieson had carried out an assessment of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s muscle tone and his temperature was normal. She had listened to </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s chest and his breathing was in order. If the chest had been tight, there would have been less air taken in and breathing would be quieter than normal. This was not the case here. It was appropriate to reassure Mrs Satha and allow </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> home. It was good practice for Mrs Mathieson to have given Mrs Satha examples of changes in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> to be noted, such as breathing becoming more laboured or feeding becoming less good. Dr Gibson said that all checks, which should have been done, were done by Mrs Mathieson. As regards family history, he said that at least fifty per cent of all children will have respiratory infection at some stage. Accordingly, it would not be unusual to find a common finding of such infection between siblings such as </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> and his brother. Regarding hospitalisation of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
  line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>, although this was not thought necessary, Dr Gibson said that he knew of babies with RSV collapsing in hospital and not surviving, even where intensive care was available within minutes. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Emergency Treatment.</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:

She woke him up at 0800 hours to give herself half an hour to feed before she took her elder son to nursery for 0900 hours. He was going on a trip. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> seemed fine when feeding. The nursery was situated only a couple of minutes walk away across the road. She put </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> in a papoose type sling and as she was walking to her front door he cried a little. She gave him a dummy and he settled down asleep. She dropped her elder son off at nursery. As she was walking back to her house she looked down at </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> and saw blood coming from his nose. She took him out of the papoose and he was all floppy. she tickled him but he did not move. At 0904 hours she dialled 999. Following the instructions given to her, she lay </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
  200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> down on a hard surface, the living room floor, and compressed his chest and gave him mouth to mouth resuscitation as part of Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> did not start moving or breathing again. She did not think that she was doing the CPR correctly. It seemed like ages until the paramedic arrived. He asked her why there was blood from </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s nose. She replied that she did not know. She stopped giving CPR as she thought the paramedic would do it better. He knelt in front of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
  line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'> but did not give him CPR. Mrs Satha then continued to give CPR. The paramedic did not have a baby's mask and told her he had to go back to his vehicle for one. He left her attending to </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>. When he was away she saw another ambulance man at her living room window and had to leave </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> to let him in the front door. The paramedic had entered by the back door. She said that the time lapse between the first paramedic leaving and the second arriving was a couple of minutes. The second paramedic came in, grabbed </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> and took him out to the ambulance.

line-height:200%'> in the house. Mrs Satha threw her house keys at the first paramedic, who then came back into the house. Mrs Satha main concern was that she thought that the paramedics should have taken over CPR from her. Instead she was left to do it herself.

He had 13 years experience as a paramedic and had been with the Scottish Ambulance Service for 23 years. He said that he part of his duties was to check his equipment at the start of his shift. He was seated in a rapid response vehicle. Amongst the equipment in the vehicle was a paediatric response bag containing <i>inter alia </i>a paediatric breathing mask and a smaller breathing mask for an infant. He said that he had checked that both masks were in the bag. His task was to get to an incident as quickly as possible. The type of call received by him was coded. A code red call required arrival within 8 minutes, amber within 12 minutes and green immediate with no time limit as such. He was positioned at Hillend Railway Station carve park when he received a call at 0904. This was shown to be 0905 but he said he had noted it as the former.

He lifted his immediate response and paediatric response bag from his vehicle and a defibrillator, which monitors heart rhythms and can deliver shock to a patient to restart the heart. He entered by the back door and kitchen and found Mrs Satha bent down beside a child doing CPR. He told her to keep on doing this. His priority was to check the child's vital signs. There was no pulse and no physical breathing. The skin was cyanosed showing a lack of oxygen and was blue around the finger nails. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> was cold to touch.

The child usually will not feed or suck well. The main reason for taking a child into hospital would be that it was not feeding well, according to Dr Gibson. There is no treatment for a viral infection unlike a bacteriological one. Dr Freeman along with the other doctors said that RSV is very seasonal from November through to March. It affects children particularly up to 6 months of age. Many thousands of babies may fall ill each year but many have mild symptoms and do not require hospital treatment. Dr Evans was not aware of any deaths in 2009 and in 2008 there were 2 including </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>. Death was accordingly very rare. In a </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
  200%'>UK</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> study the RSV attributed death rate in the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>UK</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> was 8.4 per 100,000. It can occur very quickly. RSV is a common cause of sudden infant death syndrome. From the medical evidence, unless oxygen gets to the brain within the space of 3-5 minutes, there will be massive brain damage. This is not a cause of death but the child would be profoundly mentally handicapped. The child has to begin to breathe on its own. This did not happen in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>'s case. Viral bronchiolitis may be caused by RSV but not all cases are. The bronchioles are small tubes in the airways feeding into the lungs. Dr Gibson likened them to twigs leading to the leaves of a tree. Inflammation or irritation (itis) of these bronchioles makes the tubes narrower than normal. It starts out with symptoms of a cold. The child is 'snuffly' with a mild fever and a bit of a cough. The cough becomes more troublesome as it progresses and this would be obvious to the parent. The child has to work harder to breathe through these narrower than normal tunes. This produces signs of muscular evidence. 20 breaths per minute is normal while bronchiolitis may require 40-60. This affects the child when feeding as the child finds it more difficult to suck and feeds less well and for shorter periods. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> fed normally approximately one hour before Mrs Satha noted that something was wrong. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Zion</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> had developed viral bronchiolitis with RSV as the infecting organism. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Submissions and Conclusion.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

She went on to submit that the system employed by the Scottish Ambulance Service had failed on this occasion, because a distraught mother had to administer CPR, while a paramedic looked for his equipment. I do not agree with her. There was a system in place where there was a duty on a paramedic to fully check his equipment at the start of his shift. In this case, Mr Lumsden failed in this duty. I do not regard an individual's failure in this respect to amount to a systemic failure. Mr Stark and Mr Slater confirmed that the system in place at the material time was that a full check of vehicle and equipment was to be carried out at the start of each shift by the personnel concerned. Mr Egan also confirmed this. He said that a full check would be carried out that all equipment was in place, clean and up to date. The Scottish Ambulance Service kept the equipment carried under review. The vehicle checklist was updated regularly by clinicians. In accordance with this, the masks and bags, within the next couple of months, will be marked by colour, sign and a symbol. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
