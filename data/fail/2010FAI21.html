In other words he had suffered a heart attack associated with a blockage of one of the main arteries.&nbsp; Death had been brought about by a rupture of the infarcted muscle allowing blood to leak out of the heart into the pericardium sack around it.&nbsp; When the sack fills with blood the heart stops beating.&nbsp; That event was described by Dr John Clark as causing "<i>a rapid collapse and death".</i>&nbsp; The heart attack suffered by Mr Greig would not &nbsp;have been simultaneous with the event which brought about his death.&nbsp; Dr John Clark determined from the colour of dead portion of the heart muscle, which had become yellow, that the heart attack had been suffered some days prior to Mr Grieg's death.&nbsp; Dr Clark thought it a possibility that the heart attack had been suffered on 24<sup>th</sup> or 25<sup>th</sup> February but could have occurred as long back as eight days prior to death.&nbsp; He thought there was every likelihood that the pain and discomfort experienced on the Saturday, when Mr Greig had attended the cinema, could have arisen as a result of arterial blockage.&nbsp; The pain experienced by Mr Greig might also have represented a state prior to full blockage if there had been exertion but that pain would have subsided once the exertion terminated.&nbsp; A heart attack comes about when there is a total occlusion (blockage) of the coronary artery supplying the inferior and posterior areas of the heart.&nbsp; Such occlusion leads to the interruption of blood flow which results in death to some or all of the muscle tissue.&nbsp;&nbsp; However in Mr Greig's circumstances this did not bring about his immediate death.&nbsp; The fatal event occurred when the dead heart muscle ruptured days later causing blood to leak into the pericardium which is the sack around the heart and within which the heart is held by "a scaffold of tissue".&nbsp; The leaking of blood into the cavity is fatal.&nbsp; The heart is prevented from beating and death results.&nbsp; Medical intervention offers no remedy to such an occurrence.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr Adrian Brady, Consultant Cardiologist, theorised on the post mortem findings: he considered that the arterial blockage suffered by Mr Greig was possibly total but was unlikely to have &nbsp;been less than ninety per cent of the artery; that part of the heart denied blood by the blockage would have died immediately.&nbsp; Thereafter Dr Brady suggested there was a spectrum of consequence: death could occur immediately or it might occur after a lapse of time; in Mr Greig's case there had been a rupture of the muscle leading to the admission of blood from the dead tissue into the pericardium which is always a catastrophic event.&nbsp; Dr Brady described this as an unusual occurrence and experienced by only 1% of those who suffer heart attacks; in his experience the consequences are always fatal and he had no record of this ever having been a survivable event.&nbsp; Where cardiac rupture does not occur then the heart may still function with less energy; scar tissue can form around the damaged or dead part of the muscle and the heart can continue to beat but its capacity is reduced and breathlessness in an individual would be evident.&nbsp; The risk of subsequent heart attack is increased by five per cent year on year. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr Brady considered that a cardiac rupture would have occurred regardless of whether or not Mr Greig had been admitted to hospital.&nbsp; In the conclusion to his report prepared at the request of Dr Anne Greig (crown production 6) Dr Brady states: </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;"it is my considered opinion that even if Mr Greig had been offered the very best services available in the West of Scotland at that time, the fact that he presented so late following the onset of symptoms meant that the damage caused by the blockage of his coronary artery had been done.&nbsp; Intervention with either thrombolytic clot busting drugs or angioplasty would probably not have made any difference and Mr Greig would still have died from cardiac rupture some days later".</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB>THE MISDIAGNOSIS</span></u></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Greig was clearly unwell from at least </span><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup> February 2007</span><span lang=EN-GB>.

That was recorded in the clinical notes.&nbsp; She indicated she would not have made any of those decisions without consultation.&nbsp; Dr Somkumar had been a junior doctor within Accident and Emergency in the Royal Alexandra Hospital since 6<sup>th</sup> February 2007 i.e. for a period of approximately 3 weeks prior to Mr Greig's presentation.&nbsp; Previously she had been in a number of posts in </span><span lang=EN-GB>India</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span lang=EN-GB>.&nbsp; She had been a Senior House Officer in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Royal</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alexandra</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> in obstetrics and gynaecology for 6 months prior to her moving to Accident and Emergency.&nbsp; She had trained and qualified in </span><span lang=EN-GB>India</span><span lang=EN-GB>.&nbsp; She accepted that she had little exposure to ECG interpretation.&nbsp; Heart disease in </span><span lang=EN-GB>India</span><span lang=EN-GB> was not prevalent and the focus of her training there was in infectious diseases.&nbsp; She recalled that she had around three hours of formal teaching on ECG interpretation and was aware of her limitations and that therefore her practise was to seek guidance when an ECG had been undertaken.&nbsp; As she had neither memory of Mr Greig's attendance at hospital nor of her clinical examination she could only conclude that if it was recorded that the ECG was "normal" then that could only be attributed to an interpretation made by a middle ranking or senior doctor to whom she had referred her preliminary diagnosis.&nbsp; She had no reservation about her inability to interpret an ECG accurately nor had she any reservation about seeking advice from a senior colleague either at middle grade or as consultant.&nbsp; Her management plan could only be formulated with the approval of a consultant or senior doctor as was recorded in her clinical notes.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor to whom she referred was Dr Mason a staff grade doctor within the Accident and Emergency Department.&nbsp; He similarly gave evidence that he had no memory of Mr Greig nor of any consultative involvement with Dr Somkumar.&nbsp; He did recall Dr Somkumar in the Accident and Emergency department.&nbsp; He had had no knowledge of Mr Greig's death until so advised in the spring of 2009.&nbsp; As he had no specific recollection of any consultation with Dr Somkumar he could only rely on what would have been his normal practise when reviewing an ECG.&nbsp; Dr Mason did not demur from the proposition that he had had a case management conversation with Dr Somkumar.&nbsp; He did not think that he had seen the clinical notes that would have prompted any proposed care plan.&nbsp; He considered that in all probability he had been provided with an oral account of Dr Somkumar's clinical findings which would have been entirely consistent with her diagnosis. Although he had no memory that he seen the ECG, had he done so he would have signed it as having been noted by him as &nbsp;was his normal practice.&nbsp; He had not considered that he would have deviate from that practice.&nbsp; The conclusion to be reached by him, therefore, was that he had not seen the ECG.&nbsp; He accepted that on reflection there would have been no difficulty in him looking at the ECG and that in retrospect he probably ought to have looked at it personally.&nbsp; However at the time of Mr Greig's presentation he had no reason to challenge Dr Somkumar on any of her clinical findings and had proceeded on a working assumption that she was ECG literate.&nbsp; When the ECG was brought to his attention in the course of the subsequent investigation by the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Royal</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alexandra</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> into Mr Greig's death in 2009 he had expressed shock as to the diagnosis which had been made by Dr Somkumar.&nbsp; He agreed that the ECG disclosed an extremely obvious cardiac abnormality which conflicted dramatically with Dr Somkumar's diagnosis. The secondary diagnosis of a urinary tract infection was a diagnosis with which he could no longer concur as there was a paucity of symptoms to support that finding; &nbsp;if the ECG was omitted from the clinical findings there were sufficient symptoms might still have supported a diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis.&nbsp; However Dr Mason accepted that once the ECG was introduced into the diagnostic matrix that diagnosis could not stand and that there had been a clear and evident misdiagnosis of Mr Greig's condition. &nbsp;The ECG and recorded symptoms,when taken with the clinical history, were entirely consistent with each other.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There is no doubt that the ECG disclosed a serious cardiac condition which would have prompted immediate hospitalisation and pro-active treatment of the patient.&nbsp; I can make no finding as regards the truthfulness or otherwise of either Dr Somkumar or Dr Mason.&nbsp; Both doctors did not impress me as being deceitful.&nbsp; Neither had a specific or general memory of the event and were relying on their normal practise procedure at that time.&nbsp; There was no evidence that the Accident and Emergency Department was particularly busy or that either doctor was under any extraordinary &nbsp;pressure which might have compromised their approach to the patient.&nbsp; The target time for consultation for a patient triaged at '4' was two hours however Mr Greig was seen within one hour which would suggest a ward not working at its full capacity. Dr Brady interpreted the ECG as being so clearly evident of cardiac malfunction that it could not have been a marginal decision as to whether or not it disclosed normal heart activity. The interpretation of the ECG was critical for diagnosis of the heart attack and for the immediate and future management of Mr Greig's condition which might have required an acute angioplasm or thrombolysis. In the absence of the ECG the consensus from all the Doctors lead in evidence was that a diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis might stand.&nbsp; Quite often the symptoms of that condition can mask cardiac disease. However context is of significance equally: when dealing with a middle aged man from the west of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> with a family history of heart disease the epidemiology would favour scrutiny of whether the symptoms experienced by the patient were more clearly aligned with cardiac disease than with an epigastric complaint.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I leave aside Dr Somkumar's diagnosis of a urinary tract failure as this has no immediate bearing on the inquiry.&nbsp; That was accepted by all doctors to the Inquiry&nbsp; that the diagnosis was unsupportable.

The review concluded that had there been automatic interpretation software in place at the time of Mr Greig's presentation then there would have been a benefit to the diagnosis of Mr Greig's condition. As a direct consequence of Mr Greig's death the use of automatic interpretation software is used throughout the Greater Glasgow Health Board.

Rupture of the heart is an unforeseeable event and regrettably it may have happened regardless of any medical intervention.&nbsp; Such a rupture is uncommon.&nbsp; On the evidence I heard as regards Mr Greig's pathology I do not consider it appropriate that I should make a finding under Sections 6(1)(c), (d), or (e) of the Act.&nbsp; On the evidence it is clear that no reasonable precaution could have been taken by the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Royal</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alexandra</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> whereby Mr Greig's death might have been avoided.&nbsp; I cannot concur with the view of the Crown or of Mr Watson that I should make such a finding.&nbsp; Dr Brady was quite clear in his terms that the benefit of Mr Greig's admission to hospital would have accrued to his family who would have been better placed and counselled to deal with his condition.&nbsp; That is outwith the remit of the Inquiry. The evidence does not support a recommendation that all ECG equipment should have automatic software interpretation installed.&nbsp; Such a recommendation would, in my view, demand an unequivocal endorsement of that software by the medical profession .&nbsp; The use of the software is undoubtedly controversial and is not universally supported.&nbsp; I heard no evidence from any party to the Inquiry which would allow me to take such a view. However the fact that there has been no adverse report as to the performance of automatic interpretation software in ECG equipment, in any prejudicial sense to a patient, strongly supports the continuance of the interim measure currently in place within GGHB.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I have no recommendation to make arising from the circumstances of Mr Greig's death which are in the wider public interest.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There are, however, a number of issues arising from the evidence which do merit comment.&nbsp; Firstly, I find it extraordinary that a middle aged man with a family history of coronary disease who complains of chest discomfort and indigestion was not immediately referred by NHS 24 to a hospital.&nbsp; Although it was accepted that even by </span><span lang=EN-GB>10:57</span><span lang=EN-GB> on Sunday 24<sup>th</sup> February <i>"the horse had already bolted"</i> (Dr Dixon) the advice received by Mr Greig as relayed to Dr Greig was singularly inadequate and incompetent.&nbsp; I heard no evidence on behalf of NHS 24.&nbsp; Dr Greig's account of what she was told by her husband was not in dispute.&nbsp; There was little information before the Inquiry as to what Mr Greig had actually told the NHS 24 advisor, however, one would regard age combined with chest pain or discomfort to immediately prompt a hospital referral.&nbsp; The advice given was insufficient and any reference made to a potential and protracted wait in an Accident and Emergency Department was wholly inappropriate.&nbsp; If indeed NHS 24 err on the side of hospital referral as was suggested&nbsp; that principle is to be applauded.&nbsp; However, if such advice is conditioned with a caveat as to accident and emergency waiting times then that should be addressed.&nbsp; No link can be made however between the advice from NHS 24 and Mr Greig's death and any comments made by me are advisory only. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Secondly, As regards the misdiagnosis of Mr Greig's coronary condition by Dr Somkumar it seems to me more likely than not that Dr Somkumar was persuaded by what Mr Greig presented as his immediate medical history.&nbsp; That presentation may have conditioned the approach taken by the junior doctor in arriving at her diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis.&nbsp; Whereas it is in the nursing notes that Mr Greig had referred to his family history of coronary disease there is no clear evidence that Dr Somkumar had acknowledged that in the notes.&nbsp; There remains a possibility that had she done so that may have diverted her thinking from a gastric to a cardiac disorder.&nbsp; If the notes were read by her then that history appears to have been overlooked in her diagnosis.&nbsp; That seems all the more surprising when she distinguished between the pain described as a burning sensation from pain which could be noted as a crushing pain. She made a clear distinction in her clinical examination.&nbsp; An ECG was carried out which clearly identified an obvious abnormality in the rhythms of the heart.&nbsp; The identification of that pattern ought to have actioned an immediate referral to the coronary care unit.&nbsp; Regrettably the audit trail is lost. Consideration should be given, in my opinion, to a form of confirmation that the salient clinical/nursing notes have been read and understood by the consulting doctor.&nbsp; Had Dr Mason signed, as he would normally do, that he had seen the ECG then he would have clear responsibility for its misinterpretation.&nbsp; Where an ECG has been looked at a record should be maintained as a matter of practise by the individual who carried out the interpretation. &nbsp;Similarly a review of notes made by junior doctor by a senior doctor should be a matter of uniform practice and an annotation made to that effect.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Thirdly, it is encouraging that GGHB required&nbsp; no encouragement to apply automatic interpretation software to all ECG equipment; the fact that false positives are thrown up is to my mind preferable to the situation which has given rise to this Inquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view it is for the Glasgow Health Board to determine in the light of all clinical evaluation of the software whether the interim measure in place should continue on a permanent basis.&nbsp; The use of that software had a clear bearing on whether or not Mr Greig would have been admitted immediately to hospital though it may not have served any purpose beyond that.&nbsp; The use of such software combined with training and supervision should pre-empt a repetition of the misdiagnosis that was made in respect of Mr Greig.&nbsp; The handbook provided to junior doctors when taking up employment with Greater Glasgow Health Board now provides <i>inter alia:</i> </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom:
