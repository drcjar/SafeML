Pressure had been placed on the wound site for eight minutes at the end of the procedure. Dr Millar thereafter began preparing his notes. His nursing team drew his attention to the fact that there was further bleeding around the groin and accordingly he applied pressure for a further fifteen minutes to ensure that bleeding had been stopped.

Because of the extent of Mrs Wilson's iliac disease it was essential that either Mr Scott or Dr Millar carried out any remedial procedure in the near future. Any excessive delay in either proceeding with the angioplasty or surgical intervention would have diminished Mrs Wilson's chances of survival as her condition was worsening naturally as evidenced by the deterioration between June and September.

In his final submission Mr Stewart pointed out that when she conducted her post mortem Dr Black had perhaps not been fully aware of the major difficulties and extent of the procedure carried out by Dr Millar and how close to the aorta itself he had required to work.

That affect however is not necessarily long-term and the commencement of rehydration should have flushed any effects from the kidney. Whether the kidneys had been further damaged as a result of the presence of the dye cannot be ascertained with certainty but it is certainly a possibility. It requires to be borne in mind that Mrs Wilson's creatine level did not rise significantly post procedure (See Dr McKenna's blood sample results) nor did Dr Price find any evidence on 20 September of the kidneys have suffered at that time from any adverse effects attributable to the dye.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>Thirdly, as Dr Millar in his evidence stated, cholesterol emboli was dislodged in the course of this procedure as would be expected.

His contention, which I believe is correct, is that there were no reasonable precautions which Dr Millar himself could have taken which would have resulted in Mrs Wilson's death being avoided and there were no defects in his system of working although there were, Mr Stewart conceded, system failures within the hospital which led to Dr Millar having insufficient information prior to starting the procedure.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>Mr Coll's task, as representing NHS Lanarkshire, was a difficult one.

It would be very easy, he argued, to review the tragic circumstances of Mrs Wilson's death and in the light of the changes made subsequently, to argue that all of these changes should have been made before her death. I agree with this. I have endeavoured to restrict my findings, where they are critical, to matters supported by the evidence. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>Dr Rodgers, in his evidence was very clear as to what was appropriate practice in 2010 and what was acceptable in 2006.

I have no hesitation in doing so and on the contrary consider that Dr Millar did his task conscientiously and thoroughly based on the information available to him. I also agree with his contention that Dr Millar in his evidence emphasised the need to weigh up the risks of procedure against the benefits likely to be obtained and that he considered based on his findings in September 2006 that Mrs Wilson's condition appeared to have deteriorated since the time of her angiogram in July. This supports the view which I have formed that the timescale available to Mr Scott and Dr Millar to intervene in Mrs Wilson's case was limited and that they did not have a lengthy period of time to allow her kidneys to recover. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>I also consider, based on the evidence which I heard from Dr Price, that it is exceedingly unlikely that Mrs Wilson's kidney function would have improved by any significant amount even if the renal physicians had been given an unlimited period of time to carry out their work. It also requires to be remembered that Mrs Wilson had already suffered a number of strokes and that she was in a weak condition as a consequence of her poor appetite and loss of weight as well as her vascular and renal problems.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>Mrs Wilson's death had a profound effect on a number of people. Firstly and most importantly, to her family who lost a loving and much loved relative. It clearly also had a significant effect on the hospital and resulted in considerable changes in the procedures within the hospital. It affected members of the staff, including Dr Millar, but in particular Mr Scott. In the course of his evidence Mr Scott had been clearly profoundly affected by the circumstances of Mrs Wilson's death. In my view, he quite wrongly felt responsibility for it. There was no evidence whatsoever that Mr Scott did not act in a totally professional manner. When Dr McKenna drew to his attention the terms of the adverse biochemistry result he and his staff did everything possible for Mrs Wilson. Dr McKenna herself put into immediate effect everything which could possibly be done and her thorough notes reflected the care which she gave to Mrs Wilson.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>While I accept that Mr Scott will naturally feel that this was a death which occurred in his unit and will always wonder whether if certain procedures had been in effect or had been properly followed that Mrs Wilson could have survived, there is no evidence that any fault whatsoever is attributable to him personally. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>Mrs Wilson was a very ill lady when she entered the hospital. The failure to indicate the procedure which Mrs Wilson was to undergo to the biochemistry department or to find out and appreciate the results which were available on 18 September are factors which diminished Mrs Wilson's chances. The fact that neither Dr Mirghani nor Dr Millar had access to those results was a further factor. The failure to complete properly the card requesting the procedure prevented Dr Mirghani and Dr Millar from realizing the true position and further diminished Mrs Wilson's chances. Her own condition, her persistence in smoking which increased the vascular problems she was suffering from as well the natural consequences of the procedure which was essential, namely, potential bleeding into the soft tissues and the dislodgement of emboli were further factors which diminished Mrs Wilson's chances of survival. Sadly, the combination of all these led to her death. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Tahoma'></span></p></div></body></html>
