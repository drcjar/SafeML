Thus the objective of such a public enquiry must be to ensure where lessons can be learned and steps taken to avoid any future recurrence, that these are identified and brought to the attention of those who are in a position to implement them. In this connection, it is a legitimate aim of an FAI brought under section 1(b) where there may be serious public concern, that wherever possible, that concern is assuaged and public confidence restored.

As Mr Lowrie observed, the family still felt "very raw" about Mrs Lowrie's death. She was an important and well loved part of the extended family and was plainly still much missed. Although it was clearly difficult for Mr Lowrie to give evidence, he did so with the composure, dignity and an objectivity that can sometimes in such circumstances be difficult to maintain, an objectivity which he also demonstrated in his letter (Crown production number 15), about which I say more later in this determination.

However, a number of witnesses, including Dr McEwan, Dr Patel and Professor Imrie recognised that verbal transmission of information was part of the normal currency of a medical team.
