font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>1. It may be helpful to make some introductory comments so that, on the one hand, the objectives and purpose and, on the other the limitations of a Fatal Accident Inquiry are understood. An essential feature of the procedure is that evidence is given in public so that the knowledge of those of responsible for investigation of the death and the accident leading to the death is shared with the public and in particular with legitimately interested parties, including of course the relatives of the deceased. The inquiry therefore fulfils the important purpose of enlightening those with a legitimate interest as to a cause of death. It also serves the purpose of ascertaining whether any reasonable steps could or should have been taken whereby the death or the accident might have been avoided, whether any defects in any system of work contributed to the death or the accident and allows the sheriff to describe any other facts relevant to the circumstances of the death. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

A Fatal Accident Inquiry is an exercise in fact finding, not in fault finding and it is not the function of the court to make findings or express opinions on questions of fault or liability, to attempt to apportion blame. This does not mean, of course, that the evidence led at an inquiry may not disclose fault. In that event a finding implying or imputing fault is competent. However the whole object of impartial public inquiry is to get at the truth and to see to it so far as humanly possible that any mistakes discovered, whether they arise through fault or some other reason are not made in the future. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

The very wide power given to a sheriff in a Fatal Accident Inquiry must also be exercised with caution, bearing in mind the summary nature of the pleadings and the lack of formal written pleadings.

The evidence of Mr Henderson was less important but I found his letter, which I have referred to in my findings in fact, to be redolent of at least a lack of reliability and quite possibly candour.

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>9. Equally in terms of Section 6 (1) (b) of the 1976 Act I require to determine the cause or causes of death and any accident resulting in death. Again this is not in any way controversial in that the cause of death was electrocution due to an accident at work. That is set out in Crown production number 9 being a post mortem report conducted by Marjory Black and Julie McAdam, forensic pathologist, into the death of Darren Taylor and the terms of that report are agreed to be true and accurate and so form sole cause of Darren Taylor's death. The immediate circumstances which led to that death were that Mr Taylor was driving a lorry with a mounted crane attachment at North Kirktonmoor Farm, Eaglesham. He was off loading a container from the lorry using the crane which he operated from the controls fixed to the left hand side of the truck. In the course of lifting the container from the flatbed of the truck the crane boom touched overhead electricity wires. The electricity flowed to the ground through the crane jib and down via the controls which Mr Taylor was using, and ultimately through Mr Taylor himself. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>10. As this case continued it appeared to me that some aspects became reasonably clear e.g. that the yard at North Kirktonmoor Farm was being used for storage of work materials which were not placed there for the benefit of the farm but were present to be used in the future, if required, for EIS's building work and as a convenient place to dump materials.</span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-21.0pt;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>11. What however we can only guess at is what was in Darren Taylor's mind after he arrived at North Kirktonmoor Farm. Having heard all of the evidence it seems to me that this can only be a matter of speculation. Did he see the overhead wires? His training and the warning signage on his vehicle was very much to the effect that he should look out for such wiring. It was clear from all of the evidence that it was up to him to carry out a risk assessment. Did he simply miss the wires? It is difficult to see how he could do this particularly when the evidence was that in order to carry out the unloading of the container he would have climbed upon the container leaving him less than 5 feet below the wires. Alternatively did he see the wires but for some reason assume that they were not electrical wires but instead telephone wires? Again it is difficult to see why he should have reached that conclusion. There were warning signs on the poles and in any case it is difficult to see why knowing the dangers from electrical wires Mr Taylor would have taken such a risk without being quite clear. In passing I would have thought that had the crane touched non electrical wires it would still have created difficulties for the operation with possible damage to the crane and/or the wires. Alternatively did he simply miscalculate believing that his crane would avoid the wires? Or did he wrongly believe that having been directed to the yard by William Sawers that the yard must be safe? Having heard all of the evidence I am no clearer about which of these is the answer. The clear evidence given in particular by Mr Morrison was that Darren Taylor was an extremely conscientious worker who was always keen to get the job done. On the one hand such a worker would presumably take care to avoid risks. Or did he, in his desire to be helpful and not delay matters, take a risk which would prove to be fatal? Standing my finding that there was room in the yard to place the container safely that theory could only be applicable if either he was unclear about that or having realised the danger decided not to delay things by starting again. It has to be speculation and I am unclear that in any case why starting to unload in a slightly different part of the yard should delay things significantly. There is no doubt however in my opinion that had a risk assessment been properly carried out by Mr Taylor and then acted upon the accident would not have occurred since he would not have let his equipment go within fifteen metres of the overhead wires within the yard</span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-21.0pt;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>12. As I have indicated I am satisfied that the farm and in particular the yard was a work site. It was a work site for EIS who used it for storage of and disposal of building materials. EIS therefore should have carried out a risk assessment which would have recognised the risk from overhead lines where there was activity that might create a risk of contact. It was clear from the evidence I heard that such activities took place from time to time albeit those in which lifting operations by high vehicles were probably relatively few and perhaps only took place on average about once every two years. It seems to me that at the very least there should have been very clear signage placed at the entrance to the yard, and not simply on the gates where such signs could not easily be seen if the gates were open, warning of the dangers of overhead wires. This would have been easy and might have prevented the accident although it is extremely difficult to say without knowing what was in Darren Taylor's mind at the time. It did also seem to me however that with other containers under the wires there was certainly a risk when containers were either delivered or uplifted and there should certainly have been warnings. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>13. I am by no means certain that goalposts i.e. metal frames in the shape of goalposts being the height of the hazard would have been proportionate standing the relative infrequency of operations and taking into account the property was partly a residential one, provided there were these signs I have come to the conclusion that any precautions taken by Scottish Power would most likely have been of little consequence here. In the first place Matthew Sawers' attitude that the wires were safe and he could not recall whether or not he had been given Form GS6 did rather indicate to me that he was not particularly concerned about the situation and he would have been highly unlikely to have taken any action. Secondly even had Matthew Sawers taken action here I think it an even more remote possibility that William Sawers would have shown any more interest that he did when Darren Taylor arrived at the property and in particular warned him about the overhead wires. It is also fair to say that I simply did not accept Mr Matthew Sawers' evidence that he was not aware of there being danger from the overhead wires, albeit his evidence was by no means consistent on this point. It should also be borne in mind that there was already signage on the poles within the yard which stated, "Danger of Death" and again I am of the view that further education, if indeed any was missing, would in all probability have made no difference. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>14. Equally it does seem to me that any precautions which are to be taken have to be proportionate to the frequency of operations in the vicinity and indeed this was emphasised by a number of witnesses. On that basis I do not consider that it would have been a reasonable precaution to have permanently established barriers running down the middle of the yard. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>15. On the basis that this was a construction storage site for EIS it appears to me that when EIS ordered the container they would normally have been expected to have identified a safe and suitable place for it to be delivered. However I have no doubt that EIS assumed their managing director or his family were taking responsibility for the delivery but I am of the view there should have been liaison regarding the delivery to what I have found to be work premises. Since I accept that Jordan of EIS was contacted by Mr Kirkcaldy regarding the delivery date and time that information should have been provided to those at the locus i.e. Mr &amp; Mrs Sawers, so that consideration could have been given in advance to proper instructions being given to Darren Taylor particularly when EIS must have known that part of the premises to where the container could potentially have been delivered were used for work purposes. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>16. Contrary to what is submitted on behalf of EIS I am of the view that EIS have to accept some responsibility for the safe delivery of this container. They had previously carried out business with R B Farquhar. The fact that the container was being utilised for personal rather than company purposes does not seem to me to be of any consequence. If they were going to order a container to be delivered to a workplace, which is what they did here, then it appears to me that ultimately they have responsibility for the workplace being safe. If they did not wish to assume such responsibility they should not have let their name be used to obtain the container. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

I am of the view however that this is not really a "lively possibility" bearing in mind there is every indication that Mr Taylor had an excellent view of the overhead wires both whilst on top of the container and whilst on the ground. It does not seem to me, based upon the evidence I heard that Darren Taylor's view of the overhead wires would have been improved had he been using an overhead device. </span></p><p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
