It is not truly an inquiry, and it is not the appropriate forum for determining negligence, or civil liability and thus such inquiries should not enter into a discussion of negligence. This is in contrast to the position which existed under the previous legislation. Accordingly, in the context of this inquiry, it is not the function of the court to look for evidence of fault in the care, management or supervision of the late Mrs Taylor.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>EVIDENCE TO THE INQUIRY</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB><span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">&nbsp;</ins></span></span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

Mrs Taylor, whose date of birth was </span><span lang=EN-GB>10 December 1943</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and thus was aged 65 at the material time, became unwell in early September 2009. She felt shivery, and generally unwell, with flu-like symptoms. She felt better by about Monday 14 September, but by the Wednesday, she was feeling unwell again. She now had diarrhoea, was fevered, and had vomited. Her partner Mr Moore, sought advice by calling NHS24 on Friday, Mrs Taylor having taken paracetamol for a few days. He received advice from the flu line, which had been set up in response to a declared pandemic of swine flu. As she showed no signs of improvement on Saturday<span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">,</ins></span> 18 September, he again called NHS 24. Mrs Taylor spoke with the advisor, probably an experienced nurse, and after considering her symptoms, a call-back by a GP was offered. Within one hour, Dr Middlemiss called Mrs Taylor, and having spoken to her, advised her to attend at the Out of Hours GP clinic within Victoria Infirmary, at 1405. Having seen her, and formed a preliminary diagnosis of gastroenteritis, Dr Middlemiss decided to have Mrs Taylor admitted to the hospital. After discussions with the bed co-ordinator, she was admitted to Ward 7, infectious diseases, arriving there at about 1500. She was seen by a nurse, then at about 1545, she was seen by Dr Egom. His view was that she required Oxygen, intravenous fluids, paracetamol and tests. His preliminary diagnosis was that she had swine flu. In any event, he was unable to give fluids as he failed to obtain venous access. He called for assistance from the Intensive Care Registrar, Dr Basu who arrived at about 1700. He noted a deterioration in Mrs Taylor's condition, that she was in respiratory failure, was dehydrated and that a chest X-ray had not been done. He too attempted to obtain venous access, but failed. By 1745 he had discussed the problems with the Medical registrar, agreeing that a higher level of care was needed, and a central line inserted.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

They considered that something must have gone wrong with Mrs Taylor's care, on the basis that she had walked into the Out of Hours surgery at 1405, been alert and talking at 1800, yet had died the following morning. Perhaps the "hysteria", as it was described, surrounding swine flu had influenced the decisions regarding, and treatment of, Mrs Taylor. It was against this background that this Inquiry was held. The critical evidence came from the various medical witnesses. For the family, and for the Crown, it was said that there were a number of areas that required scrutiny. These were, firstly, the decision of <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06"></ins></span>Dr Middlemiss not to admit Mrs Taylor directly to Accident &amp; Emergency after speaking with her on the telephone at 1122; secondly, the decision of Dr Middlemiss, after discussion with the bed coordinator, to admit to Ward 7 and not A&amp;E after consultation at 1430; and thirdly the delay in administering standard and appropriate treatment in Ward 7.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

She is a General Practitioner of many years experience, who is employed by Fife Health Board in the Out of Hours service. This service was set up some years ago to provide GP cover between </span><span lang=EN-GB>6pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>8am</span><span lang=EN-GB> weekdays, and all weekend. There is an interface with NHS24, which is a national telephone service offering advice to those who call. This advice can be in the form of reassurance; to self treat; to contact a GP in due course; to arrange an appointment with an Out of Hours GP; to arrange for such a GP to contact the caller; to arranging direct admission to hospital by ambulance. There are wide ranging options, and advisors are assisted by algorithms, which suggest appropriate outcomes. In the instant case, although the algorithm suggested that the patient be admitted to hospital, the advisor decided to ignore the computer, and ask a GP to contact Mrs Taylor. There was no real criticism of this process. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

She notes the various symptoms, and the time they have been with her. She realises that she needs to be seen for assessment, and offers an appointment for 1405. It was suggested that instead of doing this, she should have told Mrs Taylor to immediately present herself at A&amp;E. <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">Support</ins></span><span class=msoDel><del cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">support</del></span> for this contention came from Dr Toft and, to a lesser extent, Dr Swann.

It was clear to him, and ought to have been equally clear to Dr Middlemiss, that Mrs Taylor was very ill, and needed investigation and treatment as soon as possible. Breathlessness, coffee ground vomit, fevered and shivery were all clues to the severity of her condition. Dr Swann considered that a referral direct to A&amp;E would have been reasonable, as it would allow work to commence on resuscitation of the patient. From her symptoms, she was clearly dehydrated, needing fluids quickly. The best place for that to be administered quickly would be in A&amp;E. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

The latter is a GP, who also has considerable experience with NHS24, working there from time to time, as well as working as a GP in practice. He accepted that the notes on the NHS24 printout indicated that Mrs Taylor was in need of treatment. He categorised her as being in a "potential, but not immediate, life-threatening" condition. She was not critically ill, in need of immediate resuscitation. She did not need sending to A&amp;E, but instead to have her come to the Out of Hours clinic for examination and assessment was the correct and appropriate decision. <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06"></ins></span>Mr Anderson, a forcefully opinionated witness, disagreed with Dr Toft and Dr Swann in just about all aspects of their evidence. Insofar as their evidence dealt with what went on in A&amp;E departments generally, I consider that he had the personal experience to justify such criticisms. However, I did not consider it was his place to comment on the actings of a GP such as Dr Middlemiss. The same can actually be said of Drs Toft and Swann, who were in my opinion straying beyond their areas of expertise in this regard. Thus I was left with the evidence of Dr Middlemiss, and her explanations of what she did, and reasons for it, together with the opinion of Dr Smart whom I accept as helpful and in point to the Inquiry. With the benefit of hindsight, it undoubtedly would have been beneficial to send Mrs Taylor to A&amp;E following initial contact with Dr Middlemiss, but I make no criticism of her at all in deciding to see Mrs Taylor. Given the underlying fears of swine flu, about which I will say more later, the decision she took at 1122 was reasonable and professional. That disposes of the first area of concern.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

She carried out a full examination, according to her testimony. However, she had to accept that her notes did not record that she had sounded her chest. She insisted that she had done so, and that it was clear. Having decided that Mrs Taylor needed admission to hospital for further investigations, and fluids, she called the bed coordinator. This person was Isla Smith, a nurse, of about nine years experience. She was well aware of the instructions given, in the form of protocols and algorithms, for the admission of patients with suspected swine flu. The hospital had developed a policy, which was spoken to by Dr Birnie, the Medical Director, operational division NHS Fife. In summary, a swine flu pandemic had been declared by the World Health Organisation in about April 2009. This was the first such declaration for many years, and triggered a considerable amount of discussion within NHS, and the wider world. It was the subject of daily updates on the media, and there was a significant input from the Scottish Government and all Health Boards. Contingency planning was carried out, to face what was considered a very serious threat to public health. There was concern that hospitals, and particularly A&amp;E departments therein, would be inundated with potential swine flu patients, which presented the twin problems of treatment and spread of infection. Steps were therefore put in place to prevent, or at least contain the spread of the virus. There was, from the outset, a concern that the particular strain of flu (H1N1) could be as devastating as the viruses that had caused millions of deaths worldwide in previous pandemics. Significant death rates were predicted for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>. As matters transpired, the pandemic was (fortunately) not nearly as serious as had been first feared and forecast. There can be no criticism of the steps taken in the light of initial fears, to set up what were undoubtedly necessary precautions and systems for dealing with the possible outbreak of swine flu. These precautions and systems were cascaded through the NHS on an almost daily basis, although by September 2009, the feared numbers had not been realised. The protocols remained in place<span class=msoDel><del cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">,</del></span> and<span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">,</ins></span> although I was not provided with the actual algorithm in place at the time of Mrs Taylor's admission to hospital, it was generally accepted that it was in terms similar to that dated 29 June 2009 (12/4, first inventory for Fife Health Board). I was also advised that much later editions made it clear that clinicians must also consider alternatives to swine flu as a possible differential diagnosis.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

Dr Middlemiss did not demur, but noted somewhat cryptically on her notes that "must treat as swine flu". In evidence she said that there was nothing sinister in this notation, she had merely repeated what had been said to her by Ms Smith. She insisted that she agreed with the admission route, arguing that she expected that the treatment that Mrs Taylor clearly needed would be promptly offered in the Ward. Dr Middlemiss did not consider admitting via A&amp;E, as Mrs Taylor did not seem to her to require immediate resuscitation. This decision, to go to Ward 7 rather that A&amp;E was criticised by <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06"></ins></span>Drs Toft and Swann, but supported by Drs Anderson and Smart. The basis of the criticism was that Dr Middlemiss had not appreciated the real severity of Mrs Taylor's condition, which necessitated the very urgent administration of Oxygen, fluids and antibiotics. These, it was argued would have been more rapidly provided in A&amp;E which was inherently organised to deal with such matters quickly. The reality<span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">,</ins></span> however, is that there was no guarantee that things would have moved any quicker in A&amp;E than they actually did in Ward 7.

Although it was accepted by Dr Smart that but for the swine flu situation, admission would have been via A&amp;E, I do not consider that Dr Middlemiss, and Ms Smith can be criticised for taking the Ward 7 route. One must always guard against the benefit of hindsight. The symptoms presenting at the time did not impress such urgency that immediate resuscitation was required. Looking back, it can be seen that in fact she ought to have been commenced on fluids and antibiotics much sooner, but I do not find that the decision to send Mrs Taylor to Ward 7 can be criticised.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

He repeated the readings, and by now it was clear to all that Mrs Taylor was deteriorating. He also failed to gain intravenous access, and after consulting a colleague, considered that a "higher level of care" was required. Again, this view cannot be criticised. Dr Hartung arrived at 1800, and examined Mrs Taylor. He doubted the swine flu diagnosis, correctly (as it transpired) recognising pneumonia. He noted no X-ray yet carried out, and no IV lines. Shortly after Dr Hartung arrived, nurse Ramsay also arrived, and secured venous access. The time was not noted, but was estimated at 1840. For a variety of reasons, fluids and antibiotics did not reach Mrs Taylor until 1930. These reasons included the arrival of the portable X-ray equipment, Dr McDougall and her team putting in a central line, and ongoing tests.

Criticism from the family, supported by Drs Toft and Swann, was levelled at what appears to be a significant, and possibly critical, delay in actually doing anything substantive for Mrs Taylor. All who considered what was actually done agreed that it was appropriate, but the overall picture was of delay, and that delay may have had a bearing on the outcome. It was generally accepted that the quicker that antibiotics and fluids are administered, the better the outcome. Part of the criticism levelled by <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06"></ins></span>Drs Toft and Swann was that things would have moved much quicker in A&amp;E. That may well be so, but it is an inappropriate comparison, given that I have found that the decision to admit to the Ward, rather that A&amp;E, was reasonable. Notwithstanding their views on the likely speed of treatment in A&amp;E, I do consider that the evidence as a whole does give the impression of delay. It took over an hour, after Dr Egom had failed to gain intravenous access for Dr Basu to arrive, and himself fail. It was another 45 minutes before he called a colleague. The arrival of nurse Ramsay, who actually secured the first line seems to have been by chance. He was part of a team that "roamed" the hospital Out of Hours to assist as may be necessary. It does not appear that he had specifically been summoned to help. The (correct) decision to gain access by central line took over an hour to be implemented. Dr Hartung accepted that there had been delay within Ward 7. He would have expected that antibiotics would have <span class=msoIns><ins cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T14:07">commenced</ins></span><span class=msoDel><del cite="mailto:mmclaren" datetime="2011-02-14T12:06">commences</del></span> sooner, and a chest X-ray carried out quicker. He was aware of statistics that confirmed the sooner antibiotics were administered, the greater the chance of survival. However he pointed out that Mrs Taylor had already been ill for some time, before arriving in the Ward. Mr Anderson accepted that there had been delay in commencing treatment in Ward 7, but that the intended and actual treatment had been correct. He considered that Mrs Taylor had needed urgent rather than immediate treatment.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt !msorm;text-align:left !msorm;

To some extent, I would agree. It is clear that but for the possibility of swine flu, the NHS 24 nurse advisor would have followed the computer suggestion of admission via A&amp;E. It is also clear that the bed co-ordinator would not have sent Mrs Taylor to Ward 7, but instead either to A&amp;E or (more likely) to Ward 14, acute medical admissions. In that latter case it is likely that she would have encountered Dr Hartung earlier in the afternoon, with the result that she would have been correctly diagnosed, and IV access obtained sooner. I am clear however, that the decisions taken were correctly taken at the time. However, I cannot disregard the fact that protocols and algorithms for dealing with patients such as Mrs Taylor were changed as a result of the declared pandemic. It took some time before these algorithms were amended to ensure that clinicians always considered possibilities beyond H1N1.
