I am also satisfied that if further materials (such as a ladder, plastic fencing or trench box extensions) had been requested, those materials would have been supplied. What evidence there is in this regard confirms this. A second trench box was available.

The focus of his attention was the potential for flooding at a manhole located at the opposite end of the excavation. This had occupied his time.

This was because he and others on site had become dirty and wet trying to avert possible flooding. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:-36.0pt;margin-bottom:
