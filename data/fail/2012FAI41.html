While Dr Doherty did not further investigate abnormalities in the full blood count conducted at the first medical examination of Mr Allen, the abnormalities in the full blood count were not considered to lead to a diagnosis of any particular condition. Dr Hermanns audited Dr Doherty and as part of that process audited Dr Doherty's medical examinations of the deceased.

These facts were also agreed by all the parties in the joint minute. On reaching the ladder and while Calum Reay was about to remove Mr Allen's second fin he was seen to roll back apparently unconscious. He never regained consciousness. Emergency procedures were called for around 1735 hours. No sign of life was noted between 1735 hours and 1805 hours. While there was the emission of some vomit and some colouring being restored temporarily to his face, this was more likely to due to the intensive CPR being employed by the various members of the diving team once Mr Allen was on board the diving vessel.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Cause of death.</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>There was no evidence of any accident having caused Mr Allen's death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>I make my finding having regard to the evidence of DR Priyanjith Perera, who stated that what was contained in his report of the post mortem examination, carried out by him on 26<sup>th</sup> November 2009, was his evidence. An additional report was also produced. He gave oral evidence by TV link from Colombo, Sri Lanka. He said that death was not caused by any anatomical cause. There was no evidence of drowning. On dissecting the organs the right ventricle of the heart revealed fatty tissue which was a diagnosis detectable pathologically but not in life. He said that this condition can cause death. Similarly, he noted fatty tissue in the liver which may affect adversely the cardiac conduction system, which controls heart function. This may also cause sudden death. This would only be detectable in life by appearance of a symptom such as diabetes, abdominal pain and/or excessive alcohol consumption. It could be detected by tests and a scan of the abdomen. If the liver was found to be enlarged, this might be due to many other causes. It would not be detected in a routine medical examination. He concluded that death was as a result of a multifactorial event resulting in some kind of cardiac event. Both the heart and liver conditions were independently and together capable of causing death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>In the death certificate he had stated that there was no anatomical cause, that further investigations were pending and that there were possible dive related factors. The further investigations were into evidence of alcohol or drugs in Mr Allen's system. The resulting forensic toxicology report dated 16<sup>th</sup> December 2009 was that all analyses gave a negative result.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>By "dive related factors" I take it that he meant what he said in his report, namely, that death was more likely to have been due to a combination of many conditions, which were exacerbated by the act of diving. In his oral evidence he said that, while his opinion was that the cause of death was something to do with diving, he could not reach a definite conclusion as he could not see any concrete evidence of any dive related possible cause of death. He found that histopathology of the lungs demonstrated findings consistent with sudden decompression but there was no other post mortem evidence of arterial or venous air embolisms. There was no evidence of sudden decompression taking place during the dive, which was a relatively shallow dive. There was no evidence of drowning. Dr Perera admitted that Mr Allen could have died at any time, that is, even if not diving. It is for the foregoing reasons that I do not find that the cause of death was related to Mr Allen having been involved in diving. There was no evidence of anything related to the diving operation which might have caused death, which distinguishes it from the above stated heart and liver conditions.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>While Dr Perera was of the opinion that Mr Allen was obese at the time of his death, there was no medical evidence given by any of Drs Perera, Hermanns, Doherty or Halliday-Bell to the effect that obesity was a cause of death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>While I accept that there is no definite cause of death established in this case, I have to regard medicine as an inexact science. The opinion of the pathologist, Dr Perera as to the most likely causes of death based upon his post mortem examination is, in my view, sufficient to enable me to make my finding.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Reasonable precautions whereby death might have been avoided.</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>I have made my finding as there was no evidence of any reasonable precaution which, if taken, might have avoided Mr Allen's death.

The VO2 max was 44 ml/kg/min.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>In his post mortem report Dr Perera described Mr Allen as a big obese man with fat on his body. His weight was 125 kg and BMI was 36.1. Dr Perera regarded the BMI as high. Accordingly, in the space of some 11 weeks Mr Allen had put on an extra 12 or 13 kg. Drs Doherty and Perera accepted that it was possible to gain this amount of weight in such a period.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>There was no evidence that Dr Doherty could have or ought to have foreseen that any of the conditions mentioned by Dr Perera was present when Mr Allen was examined, as they are usually identified after death unless Mr Allen had complained of symptoms. He had not indicated that he was unwell in any respect to Dr Doherty and accordingly there was no need for further ECG. Elizabeth Docherty, who was Mr Allen's partner, gave evidence that she thought him fit, if a bit overweight. He had had rhinitis, which was unconnected to any of the conditions above mentioned, just before his last medical examination and she thought that this might have made him rather underweight. His last dive before 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2009 had been in Tunisia in August 2009. She said he had never voiced any health concerns to her. He attended the gym regularly, did not drink to excess and ate healthily. In terms of the Regulation 13 of the regulations Mr Allen was under a duty not to dive if he was aware of anything, including any illness or medical condition, which would make him unfit to dive. There was evidence from the other members of the diving team and the diving supervisor that Mr Allen had not made them aware of any illness or medical condition. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dr Perera had found Mr Allen to be obese and this was at odds with the finding of less fat and more muscle by Dr Doherty as the last examination of Mr Allen. Attention, accordingly, was focused on the methods used by Dr Doherty in making his assessment of the fitness to dive of Mr Allen. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dr Doherty was a consultant occupational physician. He had been an AMED since 1994. By 2009 he was carrying out approximately 50-60 diver examinations a year. At the time of giving evidence he was still an AMED but through choice had not carried out examination in the previous year. He used the modified Chester step test to measure VO2 max this is the maximum volume of oxygen used during aerobic activity. It provided a very rough estimate of fitness and was not entirely accurate. His clinical practice involved this test based on pulse rates with sets of exercising. The HSE guidelines in the MA1 document state that exercise tests should be done. He said that there was nothing in the guidelines that demanded that the Chester step test should be used. His tests involved 5 minutes of exercise stepping on and off a 30cm high box in time with a metronome beat over 5 minutes. He would then calculate the pulse rate per minute. Age reduced pulse rate. He accepted that the modern Chester step test involved incremental increases in the step rate with pulse rate measurement taken at each stage. He would converse with Mr Allen during the exercise as once there was a moderately hard stage of exertion Mr Allen would find conversation difficult. He had restricted Mr Allen's initial certificate of fitness to dive for a period of 6 months because, although he thought him fit, the HSE guidelines indicted that a diver should be cautioned to lose weight if his BMI was 30 or above. He had lost 3 kgs by the examination on 17<sup>th</sup> September 2008 and he gave him a certificate for one year. Dr Doherty said that the whole picture had to be looked at in carrying out these examinations. Weight was not the only factor. He said that if Mr Allen had not been so muscular and if he had had prominent fat pads on the front of his body and thighs, he would not have passed him as fit to dive, even if his BMI had been 30 or 31.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dr Hermanns, who at the material time was employed by the HSE as a diving inspector, had audited AMEDs including Dr Doherty and his examination of Mr Allen. He approved Dr Doherty's certification as an AMED. However he and Dr Halliday-Bell regarded the modern Chester step test as preferable, as it was incremental and gave a more accurate indication of fitness. There is no single type of step test prescribed by the regulations or guidance. While this may make such tests reproducible, it is noteworthy that there is no consensus amongst medical practitioners employed as AMEDs as to any particular test which should be used. Dr Halliday-Bell said that even the Chester step test can be inaccurate.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>I would agree with Dr Doherty that the view of the medical practitioner who knows the diver and has actually examined him and used the findings of such examination coupled with his clinical experience to certify a diver as fit is to be preferred to that of a practitioner such as Dr Hermanns who is simply forming an <i>ex post facto</i> judgement on the reports in front of him. In any event, Dr Hermanns did not consider Mr Allen to have been unfit to dive.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>As to the question of obesity, Dr Halliday-Bell was critical of Dr Doherty's failure to use callipers or impedance to determine Mr Allen's fat distribution as provided for in the guidance. However, Dr Doherty's position was that Mr Allen was not fat but muscular with an even distribution of fat on his body. He pointed out that professional boxers may have a very high BMI but be quite fit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>What is of note is than no medical practitioner gave evidence that, on the record of Dr Doherty's last examination of Mr Allen, he was considered anything other than fit to dive. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The additional body fat found at post mortem might be explained by Mr Allen's weight having substantially increased in the period between the last examination and the post mortem.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Again in respect to fitness to dive, Mr Johnston believed that at times during the dive Mr Allen appeared to be breathing heavily. Mr Cook did not agree and invited some of his colleagues to view the video recording of the dive. He reported that they also were not of the view that Mr Allen was breathing particularly heavily. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Mr Johnston and the rest of the team were of the view that Mr Allen appeared quite fit with a rugby player's type of build.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Accordingly, there was no evidence that at the time of his last examination or at the time of the dive, Mr Allen was unfit to dive.</span></p><p class=LtrLvl1NumberList style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:

It was recorded on video and audio. A toolbox talk was given at the commencement of the day in which the dive was discussed and safety features highlighted. There was a rescue boat in position alongside the diving vessel. Mr Allen was fully equipped. The dive was well managed. As he was new to the team, Mr Johnston let him have the last dive of the day to show that the cable installation was in place. The depth was only 15 metres. There was a standby diver, Mr Reay, ready to go into the water to assist Mr Allen if required. The members of the diving team were experienced divers and four of them were diver medics who had been hospital trained to carry out medical procedures if required in an emergency. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Diver rescue practice.</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>There was criticism by Mr Cook of there not having been a diver rescue practice. One had taken place with a team not including Mr Allen some days before. The members of the diving team were experienced and their evidence was that each knew exactly what to do in the emergency which arose when Mr Allen lost consciousness. There is no evidence that the failure to have a diver rescue practice on the day in question was relevant to Mr Allen's death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Switching off video recording and putting away the diver recovery lifting gear.</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Mr Cook also criticised the switching off of the video recording and the putting away of the recovery lifting gear. Mr Johnston said that as soon as Mr Allen reached the ladder he had considered the dive to have terminated and switched off the video recording. The recovery lifting gear was also put away as soon as Mr Allen reached the ladder. The fact that this was the last dive of the day may be an explanation. It did take up to 5 minutes to get Mr Allen out of the water but given the fact that he showed no signs of life such delay cannot be held to have contributed to his death.
