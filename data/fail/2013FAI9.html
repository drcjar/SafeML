I was advised that this witness who was an officer of Fife Trading Standards who was to give evidence about the notification made by the company in relation to a modification of the cot bed post-accident. It became apparent that it was to be suggested that the campaign adopted by the manufacturers, Cosatto Limited ("Cosatto") was to be criticised. Counsel for Cosatto admitted that if this was to be an issue further evidence may have been required to be led by the company and he would require time to consider the issue. I voiced certain misgivings as to whether this issue could properly form part of my determination as it was hard to see how it would fit with the terms of Section 6(1) of the 1976 Act. After a short adjournment the Crown intimated that they were no longer insisting on raising this issue and would neither lead the new witness nor indeed another trading standards officer who had been on the Crown list of witnesses. Mr Anderson, on behalf of the family submitted that the issue of the modification campaign could properly form part of the Inquiry. In support of that submission he referred to a determination by Sheriff Kearney in <i>FAI into the Death of James McAlpine</i> (1985) and Ian H Carmichael <i>Sudden Deaths and Fatal Accident Inquiries</i> (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition), paragraphs 11-19 and 11-46.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>Mr Smith, Counsel for Cosatto submitted that this matter did go beyond the scope of an Inquiry of this sort and reiterated that he would require further evidence, including witnesses from consultants who had been instructed by Cosatto in relation to the campaign. He advised me that Cosatto had taken advice from consultants and that the campaign had been overseen by Bolton Trading Standards. It appeared that Fife Trading Standards and Bolton Trading Standards may have been at odds as to the appropriate campaign. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>I considered the issue overnight and in the morning I said that whilst I had misgivings about the relevance of this issue to a Fatal Accident Inquiry I would not stop evidence being led and once evidence had been led it would be open to me to make a determination on that evidence. I was, however, clear that if this was to be an issue it could not be raised during the course of the time then available for the Inquiry. It would not have been fair to deny Cosatto the opportunity to lead evidence relevant to this matter. I suggested that with consent of all parties it would be open to me to hold the initial Inquiry in relation to the other issues and to continue the Inquiry in relation to the campaign issue as this was an entirely separate and discreet matter. I was acutely conscious that the family were keen for the Inquiry to proceed as quickly as possible. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>Having taken instructions Mr Anderson indicated that his clients no longer insisted on raising the issue of the adequacy of the campaign.

After Ainslie's birth he first slept in a Moses basket and then a crib. As he grew the parents looked for an appropriate cot. They searched the internet and visited Baby Land in Kirkcaldy and decided to purchase the Cosatto Stratford cot bed. This cot was designed to convert, in to a bed as and when required. It had a drop side and the base could be fitted at three levels depending upon the age of the child. The foot end of the cot bed was divided into two parts so that when converted to a bed the foot board was at a lower height than the headboard. The upper part of the foot board was joined to the lower part by means of two steel pins. These were fixed on the lower part of the foot end and fitted into two holes drilled into the bottom of the top part of the foot board. There was no fixing that prevented the two parts from sliding apart. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>The cot was purchased on the 6 June 2009 and put together in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions by Mr Smith. The base was installed at the highest level. The cot bed was erected in the middle of Ainslie's room and once erected Mr and Mrs Smith carried it into the corner where Ainslie was to sleep. Mr Smith carried the foot end and noticed that the top part of the split end was moving away from the lower part. He accordingly carried the bed for the rest of the way by holding on to the lower part of the end. Thereafter Ainslie slept in the bed. Because the base was in the top position Ainslie could be lowered over the side of the cot without lowering the drop side. The drop side was only lowered in order to check that it worked during the course of construction and when changing sheets.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>It is agreed by all parties that when the cot bed was moved, the top part of the split foot end rose above its proper position and a rod on which the drop side travelled came out of its cup. This allowed the drop side to travel on a horizontal plane when minimal force was applied to it. What is equally clear from the evidence that I heard was that this would not have been apparent to Mr and Mrs Smith. At some point after Ainslie had been put to bed on 4 July 2009 he had pushed the side of the cot causing a gap to occur through which he slipped. He became trapped between the drop side and the cot base with his face against the mattress. This caused his death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>When Mrs Smith discovered him she managed to get him clear but he was white and cold. She attempted CPR whilst waiting for the paramedics to arrive and phoned her husband who was checking a patient at his vet's surgery, to come home. A police officer was first to arrive and he started to take over CPR but as Mrs Smith thought that he was being less confident as he was not used to dealing with a small baby, she again took over. CPR was continued until the paramedics arrived. I should say that there was an unfortunate delay in the paramedics arriving as it would appear that their satellite navigation system sent them to the wrong address. This caused a delay of some 8&nbsp;minutes however there is no question whatever that this would have made any difference to the final outcome. Ainslie was taken to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy where he was met immediately by medical staff who made every effort to resuscitate him but this was all unsuccessful and life was pronounced extinct at 0009 hours. It was clear from the evidence that I heard that by the time Ainslie had been found there was never any prospect of successful resuscitation. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>After this accident Cosatto made a modification to the cot bed whereby owners were provided with a metal strap which connected between the two halves of the foot end of the cot bed which removed the dangerous defect which caused this death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>THE GENERAL PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATION 2005 ("The 2005 Regulations")</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>In order to explain parts of the evidence of Mr Trinsi it is necessary for me to describe the regulations that apply to products such as this cot bed. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>Regulation 2 of the 2005 Regulations provides that a "safe product" means a product which, under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use including duration and, where applicable, putting into service, installation and maintenance requirements, does not present any risk or only the minimum risks compatible with the product's use, considered to be acceptable and consistent with a high level of protection for the safety and health of persons.

Since 1988 he has been involved one way or another with toy and nursery product safety. He started working for various testing laboratories and in 2004 he began working for Mamas and Papas who manufactured nursery products. He set up a due diligence laboratory as the company wanted to test the products to safety standards. This involved the laboratory being audited by the government run UK accreditation service.

He pointed out that the European Standard was not included in the Official Journal and accordingly compliance with the standard was only one factor in determining whether a product was "safe" for the purposes of the 2005 Regulations. He went on to explain the workings of the cot and he described clearly how the accident would have occurred. He said that he had noted that when lifting the split end the guiding rod for the drop side would come out of its fixing. This happened most obviously when the cot base was at the lowest setting but it also occurred at the higher settings, including the top setting. He accepted that he was looking for a fault but his position was that it was inconceivable that any technician in a test lab would not have noticed the movement of the split end and the rod coming free from the fixings. He said however that this did not affect the test result as it did not form part of the test. He was accordingly not surprised that there were two test certificates, one under the 1995 standards and one under the 2008 standard. His view was that this fault would have been apparent during the design, manufacturing and testing process. His view was that it was surprising that the cot bed was tested in the state that it was in. He would have expected the testing organisations to have notified the manufacturer and further design work carried out prior to formal testing, although he did not rule out testing in its defective state. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Palatino Linotype","serif"'>Mr Trinsi also drew my attention to the fact that at some point prior to Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Smith purchasing their cot, Cosatto had made a modification which would have rendered the cot safe.

There were at least two alterations which could have been made to the design of the cot bed sold to Mr and Mrs Smith which would have avoided the death. Firstly there is the insertion of a screw through the pin. This modification had been made prior to the sale of the cot bed to Mr and Mrs Smith but it would appear that old stock was still being sold to customers after that modification had been introduced. The other alteration which would have prevented the death was the modification by a safety strap holding the two parts of the split end together. Such a safety strap was provided post accident. It was also clear, as was accepted by Counsel on behalf of Cosatto that a system of work could have picked up the design defect during the design, manufacturing and testing process. It was suggested during submissions that Cosatto had been over reliant on the testing to the European standard. I am not prepared to find that there was such an over reliance. That would require evidence that Cosatto did not know about the design defect before the cot bed was sold. I accepted the evidence of Mr Trinsi where he considered it inconceivable that the defect would not have been noticed during the process of design, manufacture and testing. It is theoretically possible that the defect was not noticed until the testing stage and that the testing organisation did not draw it the company's attention but without positive acceptable evidence of that happening I am not prepared to make the finding sought on behalf of the company.
