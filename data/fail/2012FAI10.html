An Inquiry ensures that the circumstances are examined and disclosed in a forum which is in the public domain and it will seek to establish whether there were any reasonable precautions which might have prevented the death and examined whether any defects in any system of working were identified which may have contributed to the death.

There were a number of scaffolding poles in place and the evidence was that everyone knew full well this meant that they were not to be crossed. They were a fixed barrier. In other words they were there to prevent access and those who gave evidence knew that was their purpose. Beyond that barrier was a hazard hence the barrier was not to be crossed. However, to get access to the unauthorised walkway at the top of the bridge the three men clambered over or through the various scaffolding poles and, using the poles and handrails on the walkway itself, got themselves down to the walkway. A later witness, George Michie, suggested it was 12 to 15 feet from the Tower down to the walkway. Photographs produced show that getting through and over the barrier was not a simple exercise. Equipment was passed over one to another. Mr McGinlay went first, Mr MacDonald second and Mr Michael Muir third. Once Mr McGinlay was over he picked up his helmet, carrying it by a canvas handle and walked along the walkway which he described as similar to other walkways on the bridge with two rails, one on either side at about waist height. The walkway part comprised metal gratings or grilles and it sloped relatively sharply downhill from the Tower. He proceeded along the walkway until he came to what was described as a spar or a node or a bulkhead which was in fact the end of one of the main steel supports of the bridge. It created a solid barrier or obstacle between bays 1 and 2 which would require to be overcome before carrying on along the unauthorised walkway in bay 2. There did not appear to be any ladders or other means of climbing up, over and down again although there were various pieces of metal or bolts which gave hand and foot holds. Mr McGinlay climbed over it to the other side and felt that this did not cause him any anxiety. Once on the other side he carried on down the next part of the walkway and then came to a part where he saw gratings were missing. He says he became aware that they were missing about ten or twelve feet away from them. At that point there is a reasonable slope on the walkway and he had to slow himself down as he approached. He paused to consider his position. He realised he was quite close to the job and was not keen on going back along the walkway over the node and along the walkway again to the Inchgarvie Tower with a view to going down the Alimak, along the authorised walkway, and up the stepladders. On the unauthorised walkway there were handrails and there were angle irons at the bottom which would normally have held the gratings in place. He decided to put his feet on these angle irons and shuffle along sideways while holding on to the handrails. He said he was not particularly anxious about it and chose to do it because he was close to the job and wanted to get there. He then climbed up and over and on to the top of the encapsulated area. He could not get into the encapsulation area so he put his foot through in order to get access via a ladder. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

He had a black bin bag containing his helmet and was carrying it to the front. Michael Muir, on reaching the bulkhead or node between Bays 1 and 2, held Mr MacDonald's bag until he climbed up, whereupon he took his bag and Mr Muir's helmet and went over the top and Mr Muir then did the same. Mr Muir described himself as hesitant and said that he knew that this was not right. They then started to walk along the next part of the walkway, Mr MacDonald being thirty to forty feet in front of Mr Muir. They were walking down a slope. Each of them was using one of the handrails and Mr MacDonald was still carrying the bag with the helmet rather to the front or to the side. All of a sudden Mr Muir saw the bag go up in the air and he knew that Mr MacDonald had fallen. He immediately shouted that Rab had fallen.

In the meantime Mr Neilston made communication by telephone with Mr McGinlay who began to make his way down the ladders and at track level met Messrs Dowie and Muir. Mr McGinlay had heard Mr Muir shouting that Rab had fallen but had not taken it seriously describing it as a "wind-up". Similarly, when he initially got the telephone call from Mr Neilston his reaction was that it was not serious but he very soon realised that something serious had happened.

Their initial reaction was to try to distance themselves from Mr MacDonald and, when initially spoken to by the police, they told them lies. They said that Mr MacDonald had taken that route on his own and that the others had taken the correct route. Within a very short time both Mr McGinlay and Mr Muir independently became ridden with guilt over the fact that they had lied about their friend's death and they realised that they could not live with having given the police false statements.

For BB that safety induction took the form of a PowerPoint presentation and stills from that presentation form BB production No 1. This emphasises the fact that the whole bridge should be regarded as a hazard where men were working at height and everyone should be wary of slips, trips and falls. Other issues include the fact that it was a railway line and could be subject to extremes of weather. There was a specific part dealing with safe walking at height and the need to use ladders and how to use them safely. The presentation specifically said that barriers should never be crossed without authorised permission. It was recognised that barriers could be rails such as scaffolding poles put across and fixed in place to prevent access to a particular area. It was clear that the use of scaffolding poles in this way was a widely recognised and acceptable means of designating forbidden access areas. There was also considerable emphasis on what constituted a safe access route and the need to only use such routes. All of this was clearly and well known to the men who gave evidence and there is no reason to believe that Mr MacDonald's knowledge was not similar. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Shortcuts referred to both work practices and using non-authorised routes which may be a shorter distance. There was another emphasising the dangers of hurrying whether that was hurrying on site or hurrying the job. These were intended to reinforce aspects of the safety requirements as laid out in the induction. The men who gave evidence understood this and seemed to grasp the importance of such talks.

That was supposed to be done once the men had reached the actual work site but appears to have been commonly carried out in the hut or at the tea hut on the bridge where breaks were taken. The 'Take Five' forms for 27 January were signed by the four men who went out onto the bridge to do the work including Mr MacDonald. This was the opportunity for them to specify if there was anything which concerned them about the job to be done. No such concerns were raised.

It was mandatory. To breach it was a disciplinary matter. I asked one witness about this and the response was that the use of authorised walkways and not crossing barriers was "drilled into them". On the bridge itself the safe access route usually consisted of a metal walkway with handrails. This walkway was just below track level. There were also walkways made up by blue scaffold board and handrails which were also below track level. The authorised walkways were lit and signposted. There are numerous photographs amongst the Crown productions of the safe access routes or "green routes" as they were sometimes called. Access from walkways to individual work sites was generally via the use of authorised ladders.

Therefore if these men were working in the encapsulation area in Bay 3 the work face assessment should have been completed following an inspection of that work area. It should have included access to and egress from the work area. If that assessment was not carried out at the work face then, in Mr Strang's view, it became irrelevant. It was clear from the evidence of some of the work force that the "Take Five" documentation was regularly prepared before they reached the work face and was left, for example, in the tea area on the bridge. In relation to this current incident all documentation was prepared before the men went anywhere near the encapsulation area. That fact had no bearing on the accident which led to Mr MacDonald's death. All these forms were kept, filed and retained by BB. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=31 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>Mr Strang stressed that all workers or prospective workers on the bridge received training. Those who were new received induction training which was necessary to get an authority or permit or tag to obtain access to the bridge. That training dealt with all risks on the bridge. It was provided by BB and mainly through their Health and Safety advisors. It was a PowerPoint presentation and was given to all their employees or sub-contractors. The presentation contained a number of "dos" and "don'ts" and dealt with, amongst other things, safe access routes, the use of tagged scaffold and non-tagged scaffold and what was authorised and what was not authorised. BB production No 1 was a printout of that induction training and it is clear that there is emphasis given to access and egress to the work areas, safe working at height, never crossing barriers and generally taking care. Within BB as a company in general the ethos was "Conscious Actions Reduce Errors" or "</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>CARE</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>" and that was constantly fed through presentations and briefings.

For example in 2007 there were two million man hours and no "lost time accidents" with lost time being defined as accidents reportable to Health and Safety where a man was off for three or more days as a result of the incident at work. The nature of the work meant that slips, trips and back injuries were relatively easy to come by. In the period from 2007 up to January 2010 there were two lost time accidents; one broken leg and one dislocated shoulder. This particular incident resulted in the operations being closed for four to five days. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=33 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>All members of staff did an annual refresher course and management made sure no-one was missed.

These are generally designated by green boards and signage and are lit with festoon lighting at intervals of two to three metres for the full length of the walkway. From these access walkways access to other parts of the bridge would be scaffolded and would indicate a safe access route. If this required workmen to go up or down this would be by ladders contained within the scaffold and with platforms at each flight of a ladder. There was an Alimak hoist at each of the main towers for personnel use. There was no other practical method of access to work areas and this was something that was stressed to all staff on a regular basis. The issue of safe access routes was dealt with at induction, at task briefings and at risk assessments. Management was not aware of other routes being used and there were no reported incidences of other routes being used. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=35 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>John Corrigan was the project manager with </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>TKP</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'> and he too gave evidence about the education and training given to staff members. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

As far as he was concerned there had been no detailed assessment on the risk of the top or unauthorised walkway which was used by the men as a shortcut as there had been no work done on it.

He was tied on at all times and part of the rule is that there are two points of contact at all times (i.e. using hands and feet, two had always to be in contact).

It would be sheer speculation to say how they came to be missing or indeed when they came to be missing. The last time that there was any comment that they were definitely in place was probably when Mr Michie saw them in 2005.

The first reasonable precaution would have been for Mr MacDonald along with Mr McGinlay and Mr Muir to adhere to the site rules and use only authorised access routes. They should not have crossed a fixed barrier to access an unauthorised walkway. The second reasonable precaution which might have been taken was that once Charles Joseph McGinlay became aware of the gap on the walkway he should have issued a verbal warning to Mr MacDonald and Mr Muir. Mr McGinlay was clearly affected by this accident. He was at times quite distraught when giving evidence.

There was unauthorised use of the Alimak hoist by untrained personnel. There was the failure to complete the work place risk assessment at the work place. Mr McGinlay suggested that he quite regularly did not read the Task Briefing but simply signed it. He explained that he was dyslexic. None of this amounts to a culture of ignoring rules. Had there been such a culture it is unlikely that Mr Strang could have spoken of so many man hours and so few reportable incidents. Some of it would have been very difficult for management to identify. Not much if any of it came to management's attention. The companies were not expected to achieve perfection.
