The standard of proof and the rules of evidence (apart from the consideration that evidence did not require to be corroborated) is that applicable to civil business (1976 Act, s.4(7)) and accordingly the standard of proof is that of the balance of probabilities.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

It is for the Sheriff to identify the reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the death and any accident resulting in the death might have been avoided and the defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the death or any accident resulting in the death. The sheriff is required to proceed on the basis of the evidence adduced without regard to any question of the state of knowledge at the time of the accident. The statutory provisions are concerned with the existence of reasonable precautions or defects in the system at the time of the accident or death and are not concerned whether they could or should have been recognised. They do not relate to the question of foreseeability of risk at the time of the accident. The statutory provisions are widely drawn and are intended to permit retrospective consideration of matters with the benefit of hindsight and on the basis of the information and evidence available at the time of the inquiry. There is no question of the reasonableness of any precaution depending on the foreseeability of risk. The reference to reasonableness relates to the question of availability and suitability or practicality of the precautions at the time of the accident resulting in death."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

12.0pt;line-height:150%'>The Inquiry heard from a number of witnesses that the FV Aquila was a good fishing boat, both in construction and in the way that it was maintained. I heard from Professor Nick MacWhirter, a member of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects, who had been commissioned by the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) of the Department of Transport, to determine the stability of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
 line-height:150%'>Aquila</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'> at the time of the accident. An extract of his report is included as annex B to Crown Production 15, which is the Report by the MAIB on the investigation of the capsize of the fishing vessel Aquila.. Professor MacWhirter told me that this was the tenth report that he had been commissioned to prepare for the MAIB. He explained that despite the fact that </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Aquila</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> was under 12 metres in length and therefore not subject to the stability requirements set out in the Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, that, at construction, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Aquila</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> complied with the stability requirements set out in those Rules. Ballast had been added to the vessel in the intervening years which meant that at the time of the accident she no longer complied with those stability requirements, however, her non-compliance was marginal. He concluded in his report, having taken account of the conditions at sea on the date in question and the extra ballast added to the vessel since construction, that even if "Aquila had fully complied with the stability requirements, it was very probable that capsize would still have occurred." I found Professor MacWhirter's evidence on this matter very persuasive and accepted same. Subsequent to the capsize and the investigation into same, a flyer was issued to the fishing industry ( Annex D to Crown Production 15) reminding the fishing industry that: "When planning to add ballast or making other modifications to a vessel, the effect of such action on a vessel's stability should be properly assessed by a competent person."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

Mr Rowley and Mr McIlwraith described the actions that required to be taken when snagging occurs: to free a snag the skipper will firstly take the vessel out of gear, that generally rights the boat; sometimes the skipper will require to put the vessel back into gear and the vessel will pull off the snag; sometimes the winch requires to be operated and in those circumstances the vessel is knocked out of gear and she is lifted off the snag with the winch. I was told by Mr Rowley that the vessel had become snagged on an earlier tow at the reef that day and that Mr Hayton had taken the correct measures to free the gear from the snag. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

He told me that the skipper knocked the engine out of gear to free the vessel, however she came hard fast, yawed and heeled to starboard and immediately capsized. Captain Evans told the inquiry that the actions of Tony Hayton were as he would have expected and that there was no criticism of Mr Hayton in this regard.

His company had been instructed to carry out a video survey of the FV Aquila on the instruction of Sunderland Marine Mutual Insurance Ltd. The MAIB had also told Mr Beaton "the kind of things that they really needed to know". The survey took place on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;

Crown production 18 is a series of photographs taken of the upturned FV Aquila and Crown production 19 is the report prepared by Caldive as a result of the survey. During the course of Mr Beaton's evidence I was shown the video survey. What was apparent was that the cause of the snag was a very flat rock lying almost flush with the sand on the seabed. The slab was about 3 metres long, flush into the seabed at one end rising to about 200mm above the sand at the other end. The area around this rock was "sand sloping to the west" and both towing wires (warps) had become fouled on this "flat" rock.(Crown production 15, page 12, figure 5, shows a picture of the starboard warp snagged on the rock). There were no other rocks  of any size in 30 metre radius from the snagging - "....it would be near perfect dredging, you know, scallop dredging seabed, because it is sand free of rocks and obstructions". (More particularly shown in figure 12 on page 20 of crown production 15)</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%'>At the time of the initial dive Mr Beaton had only seen the starboard wire snagged on the rock but when he recovered the dredges from the seabed he discovered that the port wire had been buried under the starboard wire. He gave evidence that as the vessel had turned, the wires had slackened and a loop of wire had been created and been dragged along the seabed, before the tension had been taken back up on the wires, they had fouled on the raised section of rock (page 46). He had expected to discover that "the dredges, or one of the dredges, jammed into a rock fissure...." However the dredges were sitting on the sand and hadn't snagged on anything.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%'>He went on to say : "Even now I am staggered with the fact that this small raised section of rock was able to actually catch both wires. You know, it was.....it just happened to be in exactly the wrong place for the vessel making that turn at that time." Captain Evans was questioned about the 2<sup>nd</sup> warp being found as this had not been mentioned in Mr Beaton's report (crown production 19). He was asked whether the discovery of the second warp affected the MAIB conclusions as to the cause of the capsize. He was clear in his evidence that the cause of the capsize was as set out in the MAIB report (crown production 15) namely that "the cause of the accident was the snagging of the starboard warp" and that the other warp was most probably dragged around when the tide had turned. Captain Evans also told the Inquiry that the type of snag that occurred was so unusual that the MAIB had never come across anything like it before (page 128 day 14).</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

When he surfaced he saw Tony Hayton in the distance, he was moving at that time and was conscious. Mr Rowley told the inquiry that the water was freezing but, because he was being dragged down, he kicked his boots, his trousers and socks off. He then saw Thomas Sanderson face down in the water, he had already passed away. He swam to Peter Hilton, he found two planks of wood and some twine floating in the water and tried to tie himself to Thomas and Peter. Thomas got loose and floated away and after a while Peter died in his arms. He explained that the capsize had happened so quickly that there was no time to transmit a May Day signal.

In his opinion each of the deceased had suffered from "Cold Shock"; that is the " sudden stimulation of the cold on the skin causes this very rapid, a gasp response followed by very rapid breathing, both associated with an increase in blood pressure, an increase in heart rate and the increased distribution of blood to the internal part of the body."(page 78 day 17)</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

He concluded that Mr Sanderson only survived for about 5 minutes after the capsize. In respect of Tony Hayton he acknowledged a mistake in his report when he had referred to him as being of "slight body build" and apologised for that. Mr Hayton had suffered some traumatic experience-evidenced by the bruising that he had sustained. Again the effect of cold shock combined with his coronary condition lead him to the conclusion that he would not have survived for very much longer than Mr Sanderson. Peter Hilton also suffered from cold shock. From the evidence of Mr Rowley it was clear that Mr Hilton survived for a little longer but that despite the heroic efforts of Mr Rowley he too drowned. He concluded that he probably died within about 30 minutes. Most people would only have survived for half an hour and he would not have expected people to survive much beyond an hour in the conditions unless they had a really good fitting life jacket and were conscious enough to be able to make arm movements to keep their backs to the waves.

Later in the day he noticed the vessel again, he thought that he saw a wave coming from the left hand side and the vessel pointing towards him, it was white and blue and then it went dark brown. It took him about 30 seconds to process what he had seen and then he realised that the vessel must have capsized. He had no phone signal on his mobile phone so got on his bike and pedalled as fast as he could to get back to the croft in which he was staying. There was nobody else about, this is a very remote area. On arriving at the croft He got his binoculars from the car, saw it was a boat and immediately dialled "999". This was at 17.03 BST, about 15 minutes after he had seen the boat capsize. He was put through to the coastguard and told them that he was at Kilmory on Ardnamurchan and that he had seen a trawler capsize. He then passed the telephone to Mrs Mary Kahn, the householder, to give clear instructions. This was all recorded and noted in crown production 12, a transcript of an extract of recordings made on the "Freedom Recordings" system, relating to communications between MRCC Clyde and MRCC Stornoway and various external agencies and persons in relation to the capsize of Aquila and subsequent rescue mission.

He did so by telling ARCC Kinloss that a helicopter was not required yet.He did not provide details to Kinloss of the location of the capsize in order that they could assess whether a helicopter was required. He did not either directly task R100 through Kinloss or ensure that MRCC Stornoway were told that R177 had been stood down and that R100 would need to be tasked immediately. A telephone call was made by Peter Leyburn, at about 17.12 BST, to MRCC Stornoway in which he indicated that R177 was just getting airborne and Stornoway acknowledged that. During the course of that call Mr Leyburn was made aware that R177 had been stood down and although he tried to tell Stornoway about this, by the time he tried to tell Stornoway, they had hung up. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

Further technology was available to all coastguard stations in the UK Apart from Stornoway whereby one MRCC can dial into another MRCC's communications system without the host MRCC having to do anything. The reason that Stornoway cannot utilise this is because 6 telephone lines require to work concurrently and the local BT exchange at Stornoway does not have the infrastructure to cope with this. This was addressed by the MCA in MCA production 26 and in particular I was told by Mr MacDonald that the system was being upgraded in order that they would not have to go through the BT exchange. I was told that the change would be comparable to the difference between "dial up" and "broadband".

The impression gained from the initial communications was one of a desire by Clyde to transfer co-ordination to Stornoway as soon as it was discovered that the incident was out with Clyde's jurisdiction- not with standing the evidence given by Mr Yassin that he considered a number of issues relevant to the transfer, it was apparent to me that the only consideration taken into account was that, as the incident was out with Clyde's patch by 5 miles, it was Stornoway's responsibility.

Mr Yassin was aware of a number of Kilmorys and could not explain why he did not seek clarification from Mr Leyburn which Kilmory was being referred to. He should have done that immediately on hearing the place name Kilmory. Having taken the decision to transfer, Mr Yassin should have made sure that all the information about the locus of the incident and the tasking and standing down of R177 was transmitted verbally in clear terms to Stornoway and acknowledged by them.

No satisfactory explanation was provided by Mr Smith for adopting this course and wasting further time. The delay of 23 minutes in a helicopter reaching the incident was entirely due to procedures being followed incorrectly by both </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

He accepted that this breakdown had happened. He explained that part of the reason for that had been industrial action that had been ongoing for about 4 years; that action had meant that for about 4 years the MCA operational standards and assessment checks had not been participated in by coastguards. These checks would have consisted in a team going around coastguard stations to ensure compliance with procedures (known as OSTA-operational standards and training assessment ). These should have been carried out every 18 months but had not been done since 2007 for Stornoway. It was hoped that the planned restructuring of the coastguard would bring an end to this disruption.(pages 155-160 day16)</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
