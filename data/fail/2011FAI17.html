My assessment of the evidence presented orally is that all of the witnesses to fact who gave their evidence in that way were doing their best to recall what happened and were doing so genuinely and honestly with the intention of helping the Inquiry to determine out the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Liam.  There were occasional differences of detail between witnesses but none has given me cause for concern over the fundamental reliability of each witness and certainly none has given me any difficulty in arriving at the findings in fact that support my determination. The differences could be explained easily by reflecting upon the different standpoints of the witnesses to specific features of the events put in question in the Inquiry, or their different preoccupations at various times throughout those events or the passage of time dimming recollection of individual aspects of those events. The evidence of Mr Madden I accept unquestioningly. He was a most impressive witness, whose great expertise in electrical engineering, acquired over more than three decades, was demonstrated in his report and in the supplementary comments he made in the course of his evidence on the circumstances of Liam's death. I am very grateful to him for his analysis and explanation of those circumstances. I have placed great reliance on them in my determination.

He reported to Ms Hughes that Liam was sleeping. This surprised her because it was too early in the day for him to have a nap. She went into the toy room. She saw Liam lying on the floor in the same posture as he adopted when asleep, namely, on his front and with his bottom in the air. At first she thought that he was asleep, but on looking more closely at him she saw a spot of blood on the floor where Liam's mouth was. She then saw the cable wire underneath him. Connor was present at this time. The cable was the new cable and plug. It had been plugged into the left hand part of a double electrical wall socket in the toy room. The switch on the socket was in the on position indicating that the cable, including the bare wire section at the end of each of the three connections, was live.

The evidence of Doctor Evans, Mr McErlane, Doctor Long and Mr Madden all supports this conclusion, which I accept as the sole cause of Liam's death. Liam had burn marks present on both of his hands. Their appearance exhibited the classic features caused by electrocution. The presence of those marks on both hands is consistent with him having held an electrical wire in each of his hands with the result that an electrical current passed through his body, thereby electrocuting him. I accept the expert evidence of Mr Madden based on his examination of the new cable and plug that Liam grasped the bare wires of the live conductor in one hand and the bare wires of the neutral conductor in the other. At that time the cable was energised. As a consequence alternating current at the strength of the national supply flowed through his hands, arms and across his chest. The effect of that current passing through his body caused a massive shock to his heart. His death followed almost instantaneously. It is a merciful grace to Liam that in all probability he died before he realised what was happening to him and before he had the opportunity to feel pain. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-34.7pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Both Ms Hughes and Mr Rough saw it while it was in the living room and that was after Mr Rough had disconnected it from the new oven. Liam was in the living room at some points in time while Mr Rough was working in the kitchen and while in the living room he was showing interest in the work and the tools that Mr Rough had brought with him. Liam was aware that a plug inserted into a wall socket could lead to the television in the living room being activated. A short but unspecified time before the day in question, he had started the practice of pulling out plugs from the socket in the living room into which the television was plugged regularly. This practice amused him, which sounds as if he saw this activity as a sort of game, and that even although his mother had told him that it was bad to do that. I consider his state of knowledge about what a plug could achieve to be significant for what happened. Exhibiting the characteristic inquisitiveness of a small boy of his age, he seemed to have developed an interest in electric plugs presumably because of what that might mean for him and, in particular, I instance that it could result in him being able to watch television. I also consider that there is some significance in the fact that the socket into which the television plug was inserted and which he had been seen playing with in the house was a double socket, similar in appearance to the double socket in the toy room. The evidence satisfies me I can infer that at some unknown point in time after Mr Rough had removed the new cable and plug from the new oven and had left it in the living room it is probable that Liam carried the new cable and plug into the toy room and inserted the plug into the left hand part of the double electric wall socket in that room. The evidence does not allow me to make a finding as to whether the socket was live at that point in time or whether Liam pushed the switch to the live setting, but by some human action it became energised.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-34.7pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

These, to my mind, are precautions that are obvious, no more than common sense.

He knew that Liam, a small boy, was in the living room while he was carrying out the task of replacing the old oven in the next door room, the kitchen. He ought to have taken account of Liam's presence and young age to the extent of recognising that his work equipment of whatever description, and that includes the new cable and plug, would be a source of interest if not fascination to Liam, and that by reason of his young age this brought with it a significantly enhanced risk that the natural curiosity of a small boy had the potential to lead him into doing something that might injure himself even if his mother were also present in the same room. Quite how Mr Rough ought to have achieved the result of keeping the new cable and plug out of Liam's reach I would not feel it right to prescribe. It might have been, as the Crown suggest, by keeping them on or near his person but I cannot conclude that that was an appropriate response in the circumstances. Had it occurred to Mr Rough to take appropriate precautions there might have been many other possible and appropriate ways by which he might have achieved that result. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

To that I would add that that includes that person satisfying himself that he, and anyone working under him, has completed the task of clearing up, certainly to the extent of removing all tools and equipment however brought on site for the purposes of the job. That this general requirement needs stating in clear terms is given added force by the observation of Mr Madden in his report that leaving the new cable and plug behind in the house was an error that might have been made by other people regardless of the extent of their electrical competences which he elaborated in his oral evidence to include qualified electricians. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

It was not explored with other witnesses, particularly Ms Hughes and Mr Rough. Mr Madden said that it was a precaution to use such blanking plates in houses where there were children of the sort of age that Liam was but stressed that the provision of these plates was not a duty on landlords and it was not for the Health and Safety executive to promote their use. With characteristic precision in vocabulary he described his proposal as an advisory precaution. He did not describe it as a reasonable precaution. Doubtless that is why the depute in her submission described it as a wise precaution again avoiding the adjective reasonable. I am not persuaded that I should or could elevate the proposal to a precaution that was reasonable in the present circumstances because there simply is not the evidence to give me the facts from which I could derive that conclusion. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-34.7pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
