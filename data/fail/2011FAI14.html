It was held in terms of section </span>1(1)(a) of<span lang=EN-GB> the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 and so was a mandatory Inquiry into the death of a person who was in legal custody at the date of his death</span>. The parties represented at the Inquiry were the family of Mr. Khalid (by Mr. Skinner, Advocate), the Scottish Prison Service (by Mr. Mawby, Solicitor) and Nurse Charlotte Williams-Martin, an employee of the Scottish Prison Service who had attended on Mr. Khalid on the day of his death (by Mrs. Watt, Solicitor). I heard evidence over five days. Parties sought the opportunity to lodge written submissions. A timetable for the lodging and adjustment of these was agreed and a hearing for any additional oral submissions was fixed. In the end of the day no party wished to make further oral submissions and the hearing was unnecessary. The written submissions are with the Inquiry process.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

He had been sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment in 2003 and had been transferred to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dumfries</span><span lang=EN-GB> in 2008. He had suffered from a heart condition since 1996 when he had had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms of that were stable angina, hypertension and atherosclerosis.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

It was entirely voluntary. Mr. Khalid had attended gyms in other prisons before his transfer to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dumfries</span><span lang=EN-GB>. There was no indication that this had caused any medical difficulties or that he had experienced any problems while exercising. Prisoners wishing to participate in activity at the gym are asked to complete an induction form. When he first indicated a wish to use the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dumfries</span><span lang=EN-GB> gym Mr. Khalid completed such a form in August 2006. He disclosed his heart condition. Answers to questions in the form confirmed that he had not been advised by a doctor not to participate in exercise, that he did not suffer from shortness of breath, that he exercised regularly and that he could walk at a brisk pace for four miles without getting tired. Nothing in the answers which Mr. Khalid gave the gym staff any cause for concern. The form was retained by the gym staff. It was not copied to the prison medical centre. Before he started in the gym a fitness test was carried out. He was started off in a remedial class and his progress was monitored (including with a heart monitor). He progressed to the intermediate class. By the time of his death he had been exercising regularly at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dumfries</span><span lang=EN-GB> gym for about three years. He had reported no problems while, or as a result of, his exercise; nor were the gym staff aware of any. He appeared to enjoy his attendance at the gym and appeared to be fit. He took pride in completing the exercise programmes and did not like to be seen to lose face by failing to do so.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

About five minutes before the end of the routine one of the supervising officers, Robert Stitt, saw that he was hunched and stooped over the piece of exercise apparatus he was exercising on. He had his hand on his chest. This was most unusual and Mr. Stitt asked him if he was OK. Mr. Khalid replied that he did not feel right and said, in response to Mr. Stitt's questions, that he had pains in the centre of his chest and that he felt sick but that he did not have pins and needles down his arm. Mr. Stitt told him to change and that he would contact the duty nurse. Mr. Stitt observed that he looked normal though he was perspiring but said that this was normal after exercise. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

He told her that Mr. Khalid was having chest pains. She arrived about five minutes later. He told her that he had seen Mr. Khalid stooped over the exercise machine and that he was complaining of chest pains. By then Mr. Khalid had taken a shower. After that he mentioned to Mr. Stitt that he thought he had a touch of indigestion (he had also said that before). Mr. Stitt was unsure whether Miss Williams-Martin heard that. He felt that Mr. Khalid looked a touch better. After that Miss Williams-Martin examined Mr. Khalid in Mr. Stitt's office. Mr. Stitt then left to deal with other prisoners.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

She knew of his heart attack in 1996 and the ongoing angina and that he suffered from atherosclerosis. She was aware he would have attended the prison hypertension clinic and that he was on medication consisting of beta blockers, aspirin and a statin for cholesterol. He also had a GTN spray to relieve the effects of angina pain. Miss Williams-Martin suspected, because of his medical history, that Mr. Khalid might be having a heart attack and said that her first task was to rule that out. She examined him. She observed that he was walking normally and did not think that he looked pale or clammy. Mr. Khalid indicated that he thought that he had pulled a muscle in his chest. She took his blood pressure (120/80) and his pulse (80 beats per minute). His hand felt normal and not clammy. His respirations were normal (16). He said he had had a dull pain but that had eased off. She asked if he had any pain in his left arm, shoulder neck or jaw and he said that he did not. She asked where his GTN spray was and he responded that it was in his cell. She was concerned that over exertion in the gym might have brought on an angina attack. She asked him to wipe his forehead to check if he had been sweating and formed that impression that he was not. She then asked again if the pain had gone and he responded that it had eased off. What Miss Williams-Martin then did is a matter of factual dispute which I will deal with at greater length.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

She told him to rest and take his GTN spray as a precaution. In answer to his question about going back to work she said that she wished him to rest to dissipate the pain of his angina. She said to take GTN spray and if there was any more pain to contact the officer at his cell. She said that she would pop in to see him later. At about 15.10 she phoned Kerry Borthwick to arrange for her to escort Mr. Khalid back to his cell. She told her that Mr. Khalid had been experiencing chest pains and that he was to lie down and take his spray and was not to attend work. Before Kerry Borthwick could go to collect Mr. Khalid, Stewart McIntosh arrived (he had met Mr. Stitt). When he reached the gym he heard Miss Williams-Martin tell Mr. Khalid to lie low and take his medication and that she would see him later. Mr. Khalid told him that he felt not too bad and that he suspected he had pulled a muscle in his chest. Mr. Khalid had no obvious difficulty in walking to his cell, including climbing a set of stairs. The journey took about a minute. They met Miss Borthwick. He entered his cell about 15.15 and Mr. McIntosh reminded him to do what the nurse had said. The cell was then locked.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

As she did so another prisoner, Mr. Ullah went into Mr. Khalid's cell. Within a few seconds he had shouted "Kerry, it's Naz, he's dead". Miss Borthwick returned to the cell and saw that Mr. Khalid was lying on his bed with his eyes open and with vomit on his face. An alert was put out. Other officers arrived almost immediately. Two of them removed Mr. Khalid from the cell onto the landing and commenced CPR. That continued until paramedics arrived about ten to fifteen minutes later.

Discussions are, I was told, well advanced about a change in that arrangement and that it is envisaged that the National Health Service will be taking over the responsibility in the not too distant future. At present the nursing care is provided by nurses employed by the Prison Service. They are generally akin to nurses who would be attached to a GP practice. Medical care is provided by doctors in general practice contracted to provide that care. The previous medical records of prisoners do not follow them, as might be the case in civilian life if they transferred to another National Health Service doctor, for example on moving house or for any other reason. For short term prisoners, serving a few months, that seems unremarkable. But for men such as Mr. Khalid, likely to spend many years in prison it seemed surprising. In fairness, the provision of such records, if required, did seem possible on request but it rarely happened. The question was whether the unavailability of such records, either to the prison nursing staff or the contracted doctors was relevant to Mr. Khalid's death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

In addition, Mr. Khalid had not been prescribed an ACE inhibitor, and his blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring having not always been carried out regularly or followed up. On that basis he regarded Mr. Khalid's cardiac treatment as being less than optimal. Dr. Tait confirmed that Mr. Khalid had been prescribed a statin, aspirin and beta blockers. He also commented that Mr. Khalid's cardiac management had not been significantly worse than if he had attended a cardiac physician. He confirmed that he did not believe there had been systemic neglect and having seen a full set of medical records he was reassured that Mr. Khalid appeared to be having fairly regular checks of both his cholesterol and blood pressure. But he felt that Mr. Khalid's cardiac management was still sub-optimal. He described it as systemic failing, because Mr. Khalid had been given less than ideal follow up. His view was that this sub-optimal treatment might have contributed to the event on 23 November but he said that he could not guarantee that the fatal event would have been averted. He could only say that it might have made a difference.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

Any sub-optimal treatment was a result of failings over a number of years at Health Centres at a number of different SPS prisons including HMP Peterhead and HMP Edinburgh as well as HMP Dumfries. That points to a failure in relation to a combination of factors rather than any isolated or individual failing and so is indicative of a defective way of working of the type envisaged by Section 6 (1) (d).

The first thing which has to be said is that such participation is voluntary. And the second (this was clearly confirmed by Dr. Tait in his evidence) is that physical exercise can be beneficial for those who have had heart attacks and who may suffer from stable angina. In the context of this discussion it might be convenient to describe briefly what that angina is. Angina occurs in patients with ischeamic heart disease when fatty deposits lead to the narrowing of the coronary arteries. This reduces blood supply to areas of the heart muscle. Increased demand on the heart, such as caused by effort or exercise, brings on pain. That pain is often predictable so patients can avoid the activity or take GTN spray to prevent or relieve it. This is what is referred to a stable angina. Unstable angina is when the nature, frequency or severity of the pain changes such as when it occurs with minimal exertion or at rest. Pain which persists for more than fifteen minutes, and is not completely relieved by GTN spray, may indicate the possibility of unstable angina. That is a serious condition and a medical emergency where the calling of an ambulance and referral to hospital is advised.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

The determination of cessation of pain was the important factor in any assessment or diagnosis of that. (In fact Miss Williams-Martin acknowledged the significance of that in her own evidence.)

While it is true that there was no expert evidence from any nursing witness about what these might be expected to contain, both doctors had extensive experience of seeing and working from such notes and, it seemed to me, were in a position to give reliable evidence about what might have been expected. Dr. Crawford said that the notes were "totally inadequate" from a medical point of view. Dr. Tait was more guarded but described the recording as "sub optimal".</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

As part of her examination of Mr. Khalid, in the circumstances in which she attended on him, Miss Williams-Martin should have established from Mr. Khalid that his chest pain had gone completely. In the absence of doing so she should have called for medical assistance either from the prison doctor or by summoning an ambulance.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>[37].<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Miss Williams-Martin did not establish that Mr. Khalid's chest pain had gone completely. That is despite what she said in giving evidence. It was suggested, that in saying that she had asked him if the pain had gone completely and that he had nodded, she was lying and seeking to mislead the court. It is not necessary to say that. As I shall explain, what she said in evidence is not supported, in my opinion, by the other evidence which I heard. But that may mean no more than that Miss Williams-Martin is aware of what she should have done and, over the passage of time, is simply unable to accept that she did not do so and has convinced herself of that. Her presentation as a witness was not of someone who was deliberately attempting to mislead the court. She came across as a dedicated and caring nurse. I am satisfied that she genuinely believed that she was giving an accurate account of what she did. But it is a mistaken account which is not supported by the other evidence.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

First of all she, and the medical witnesses, acknowledged the significance of establishing the disappearance of pain and the importance of recording such a significant finding accurately in the medical notes. If the appropriate question had been asked and answered it is probable that it would have featured in the nursing notes. It is probable too that it would have been mentioned to at least one of those to whom an account of the examination was given. And the language of the note which was made tends to support the continuing existence of pain ("eased off"). That language is repeated in what was said to Dr. Sabur and Constable McKay. What was said to Kerry Borthwick ("had been experiencing chest pain") is ambivalent. So the weight of the recorded descriptions points away from the cessation of pain having been established.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

The purpose of that is to relieve angina pain. Both medical witnesses said that it served no purpose once the pain had disappeared. It is not a precaution. It seems improbable that advice to take it would have been given if it had been established that the pain had disappeared.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

It does not establish that he was suffering from any chest pain when he left the gym but it makes it less likely that he was asked if he was and answered (whether by nodding or otherwise) that he was not.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

There was the generally favourable evidence about Miss Williams-Martin's work and experience, particularly her response to two earlier incidents where prisoners had suffered heart pain and she had acted appropriately in summoning medical assistance. I took account of that but the balance of the evidence led me to the conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, Mrs. Williams-Martin had not asked Mr. Khalid if his pain had gone completely and so had not established that it had.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

It is clear that no ambulance was called and no medical assistance was sought. Beyond that it is possible reasonably to infer from the evidence that the possibility of any emergency response to the life threatening event which later caused Mr. Khalid's death was removed. The nature of that response was clear from the evidence of the prison officers and paramedics who attempted to revive Mr. Khalid for approximately twenty minutes in circumstances where there was no response to their efforts and all had formed the impression that he was dead. It is likely that, had an ambulance been summoned, and the terminal event had occurred while he was awaiting its arrival, while he was on the way to hospital or after he had arrived there similar efforts would have taken place. As it turned out he was locked in his cell when the terminal event involving his heart, and which caused his death, occurred. It is correct that Jennifer Irving spoke of situations where any response after cardiac arrest will not achieve anything for the patient but she also said there were other situations where the outcome would be dependent on how quickly paramedics reached the patient and some of these outcomes could be favourable. She could not say which would have applied to Mr. Khalid. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

Dr. Tait said that it was not possible to say with certainty that death would have been averted but he described various procedures which would have been carried out. Certainly neither doctor was asked in terms what the effect of admission to hospital might have been but I do not think it unreasonable to infer from what they said that the purpose of admission would have been to treat Mr. Khalid and attempt to prevent his death.

I agree that it might have played a part in avoiding Mr. Khalid's death but it is, strictly speaking, a possible consequence of the first reasonable precaution which should have been taken. That was to ascertain if Mr. Khalid's chest pain had gone completely. That was, on the medical evidence, the reasonable step for Miss Williams-Martin to have taken when confronted with a previously well patient with known coronary heart disease; and a previous myocardial infarction patient who had suffered a sudden onset of acute chest pain which was unusual for him. I have found that was not done by her.
