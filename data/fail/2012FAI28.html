Prior to her going into care on a voluntary basis in June 2008, Niamh had lived for a time between 2007 and 2008 in Helensburgh with her father Paul Lafferty although there were times during that period when she would return to her mother's home. Her father and her mother Colette Bysouth had separated when Niamh was two years old. Niamh then lived in Helensburgh with her mother, and eventually her mother, stepfather and two half-sisters. She had contact with her father, and her paternal grandparents who also lived in Helensburgh. In 2006, when she was spending time at her father's home, Niamh witnessed the aftermath of a very violent incident involving her father, and a local man called Brian Fallon. In the course of that incident Brian Fallon was killed, and Paul Lafferty sustained multiple stab wounds. He spent time in intensive care. He was subsequently tried for the murder of Brian Fallon and was acquitted in around November 2006. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>26. Sometime in 2007 Niamh told her mother that she had taken an overdose of 25 herbal tablets. In April 2008 Niamh self-harmed by cutting her wrists. She associated with delinquent young people in the local community who took drugs, consumed alcohol when underage and were involved in criminal behaviour. Niamh was drinking alcohol, shoplifting and truanting. When she was at secondary school she assaulted a female pupil. In June 2008 Paul Lafferty concluded that he was unable to look after his daughter. Niamh refused to return to live with her mother and her immediate family. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th </sup>June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh was received voluntarily into the care of Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She was initially placed at East King Street Children's Unit, ('</span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>') a residential facility owned and run by Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Almost immediately some of her friends in Helensburgh tried to remove her from the unit. At that time Argyll &amp; Bute recognised that </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> could not keep Niamh safe and on </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> she was transferred from </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Open Unit.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>27. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>8<sup>th</sup> August 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> at a Children's Panel she was placed under the supervision of Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> with a condition of residence at the Open Unit. She remained under the supervision of Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> until her death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>28. Sandra Leonard was Niamh's Social Worker from </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> until the end of May 2009. She was at that time employed by an agency who provided staff to Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The Senior Social Worker, Team Leader and Miss Leonard's Line Manager was Adah Lambie. Adah Lambie's Line Manager was the Area Manager Joy Daniels. Colette Bysouth worked closely with the Social Work Department both before and throughout all the time Niamh was in care and presented at all times as a loving, committed and sensible mother, who always had Niamh's best interests uppermost. Niamh however remained consistent in her wish to live with her father, at least until the summer of 2009 and was steadfast in her refusal to live with her mother, stepfather and two half sisters and was not prepared to accept the appropriate boundaries her mother and stepfather attempted to place on her behaviour. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>29. Paul Lafferty took drugs, including heroin. He associated with others who took drugs, and he had a violent past in addition to the incident when Brian Fallon was killed. He was unreliable in his contact with the Social Work Department and in 2008/2009 he did nothing to discourage Niamh in her sexual relationship with Jonny McKernan, a 16 year old local boy who took drugs and who had a criminal record. Colette Bysouth was at all times very worried about Niamh's relationship with Jonny McKernan who was also a violent young man. Paul Lafferty was at no time a suitable full-time carer for Niamh. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>30. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>30<sup>th </sup>November 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> a family group conference arranged by the social work department was held in Helensburgh to plan for Niamh's future care. Amongst others Paul Lafferty and Colette Bysouth attended. It was agreed that the long-term plan was for Niamh's eventual return to the care of her father. This was to be via a speall of residence at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> and a variety of supports had to be in place prior to Niamh's anticipated eventual return to the care of her father. At the meeting those in attendance thought that Paul Lafferty was under the influence of drugs. Colette Bysouth was very worried at what was being proposed.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>31. A Children's Panel was fixed for </span><span lang=EN-GB>16<sup>th</sup> January 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Sandra Leonard prepared a report in which her recommendation was that Niamh's supervision requirement be continued and that a condition of residency naming </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> should be made as per the plan formulated in November 2008. Adah Lambie told her to amend her report to make no recommendation regarding residence. Sandra Leonard was unhappy about that instruction and took legal advice. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>32. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>16<sup>th</sup> January 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> there was a Children's Panel. No one who gave evidence was clear as to what the decision of the hearing was. In any event Niamh did not move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> at that time because the Social Work Department were of the opinion that the mix of children resident in </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> would not have been conducive to Niamh's best interests. That assessment had not been placed before the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>16<sup>th</sup> January 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>33. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>9<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Adah Lambie completed a supplementary report amending the care plan and recommending that, while remaining subject to supervision, Niamh should be returned to the care of her father. This was contrary to the January recommendations of Sandra Leonard. Adah Lambie's recommendation to the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>13<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> that Paul Lafferty was a suitable carer for his 14 year old daughter was not supported by the knowledge that the Social Work Department had of his abilities and his life-style. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>34. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>13<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> a panel met to consider Niamh's case. Sandra Leonard was on holiday and Adah Lambie attended. On Adah Lambie's recommendation the panel returned Niamh to the care of her father, with thje condition that she continue her education at the Open Unit. There was confusion between the social work department and the Open Unit as to when the order was to be implemented. Despite that confusion, neither Adah Lambie nor any one from the Open Unit thought to have the situation clarified and the order was implemented immediately. The recommendation of Sandra Leonard for Niamh to return to her father by means of a planned transition period involving a stay at East King Street was not put before the panel nor were the essential supports which had been identified by Sandra Leonard and agreed by Adah Lambie prior to any move from the Open Unit followed up or put in place by Adah Lambie. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>35. Between 13<sup>th</sup> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> when Niamh was in the care of her father, no social work visit was made nor was any contact attempted. Niamh did not spend every night at her father's home, with her father's knowledge and approval. Paul Lafferty was unable to care for his daughter and the placement broke down by </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>36. At a LAAC Review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>18<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> in Helensburgh Niamh appeared, unkempt and very distressed. She spent that night in the care of her father, though not at her father's house. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>37. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> there was a planning meeting in Helensburgh. The decision of the meeting was that Niamh should return to the Open Unit. Paul Lafferty phoned Niamh to tell her of the decision and when her mother went to collect Niamh she ran away. She was retrieved by her mother and taken to the Open Unit after she had been allowed to say 'goodbye' to her boyfriend Jonny McKernan who had appeared as a naccused person in the sheriff court at Dumbarton that day. That was the last time Niamh saw him.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>37.

Later that month, after his discharge from hospital, he left to live in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Denmark</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Subsequently Niamh's Supervision Requirement Order included a condition that Paul Lafferty should have no direct contact with his daughter and that any telephone contact had to be supervised. Paul Lafferty committed suicide in September 2010.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>40. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh was seen in the street in Helensburgh by Sylvia Rennie, the Operational Manager of Up 2 Us. Niamh was heavily under the influence of drugs and/ or alcohol.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>41. Between 20th February 2009 and 13<sup>th</sup> March 2009 Niamh absconded from the Open Unit on a number of occasions and when at large consumed both alcohol and drugs. On 5<sup>th</sup> March 2009 she self-harmed by scratching her face and on </span><span lang=EN-GB>6<sup>th</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she drank a 200 ml bottle of witch hazel when in the Open Unit.

She required no treatment.

Immediately after the panel Niamh absconded and again consumed alcohol and drugs. She was absent for the whole weekend. During that time she had been in the company of an older man, had slept in a car which had then been involved in a road traffic accident and was subsequently deliberately set on fire.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>43. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>16<sup>th</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> on the authority of Douglas Dunlop Head of Service for Children's Services Argyll and Bute Niamh was admitted to the Secure Unit. She was takent there by Sandra Leonard.

The criteria for accommodation of a young person in conditions of security are to be found in Section 70 of the Children (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>) Act 1995.

On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> the panel granted a warrant for Niamh's placement in the Secure Unit. The warrant was renewed on </span><span lang=EN-GB>9<sup>th</sup> April 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She was placed initially in Unit 1 and was moved to Unit 2 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>12<sup>th</sup> May 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. During her time there Niamh complied with the rules and did not require secure holding. During her time in the Secure Unit Niamh refused to cooperate with the any counselling which was offered to her. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>46. In the Secure Unit, all doors are kept locked, including bedroom doors which are locked overnight. There is a viewing panel into each bedroom. A young person in secure conditions is not able to leave a room without the permission of a member of staff and young persons are accompanied by a staff member at all times.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>47. Between 16<sup>th</sup> March and </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh was allowed out of the Secure Unit only on a supervised basis. She went on a variety of outings with members of staff. All such outings passed without incident. On her 15<sup>th</sup> birthday on </span><span lang=EN-GB>18<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she had a supervised visit lasting half an hour to see her mother, stepfather and half-sisters in Helensburgh, as well as her paternal grandparents who lived in the town.

Between March and July 2009 Niamh repeatedly advised the staff in the Secure Unit that whenever she was able to do so she would 'get mad' with drink and drugs. She talked about how she would end her life. She told Duncan Shaw, a care worker in the Secure Unit, that she would take loads of 'blues' (street valium), vodka, go to sleep and not waken up. He described Niamh as being very calm, and focussed when she spoke about killing herself. She repeatedly indicated a wish to 'be with Jonny'. By that she meant she wanted to die.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>49. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>11<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Deborah Wicks was appointed Niamh's social worker in place of Sandra Leonard who had ceased working for Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> at the end of May 2009. Deborah Wicks had no opportunity of speaking to Sandra Leonard about Niamh's case. She met Niamh for the first time on </span><span lang=EN-GB>11<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She attended a 'Looked After and Accommodated Child' Review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>15<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> ( 'LAAC Review'). The Reviewing Officer and Chairperson of that meeting was Mary Walker. Those in attendance included Deborah Wicks, Edward ('Ted') Jeffries, a psychologist employed by Argyll &amp; Bute, and Colette Bysouth. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>50. The conclusion of the meeting of 15<sup>th</sup> June 2009 was that Niamh no longer met secure criteria and referral was to be made to two options (1) the Close Support Unit (the '</span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB>') and, if no place was available at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB>, (2) 'the wee flat' at the Open Unit with additional supports. No consideration was given by the meeting to a placement at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. No accommodation at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB> was available until some time in August 2009. No investigation was made into the availability of accommodation in 'the wee flat'. Deborah Wicks was of the view that prior to any move from the Secure Unit to the community a transition period was essential so that Niamh's behaviour could be tested outwith the Secure Unit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>51. After the LAAC Review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>15<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Deborah Wicks had further opportunity to consider Niamh's case. She prepared a report dated </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> for the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She recommended that Niamh should remain in the Secure Unit until accommodation in the Close Support Unit was available. She considered that a great deal of work still had to be done with Niamh before a successful transition from secure conditions could be made. She recognised that Niamh had not been tested in conditions affording her any degree of freedom, and was concerned about Niamh's regularly stated intention to drink alcohol and take drugs whenever she had the freedom to do so.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>52. On or about 26<sup>th </sup>June 2009 Roger Wilson, Resources Service Manager, Argyll and Bute spoke to Douglas Dunlop, Head of Service for Children and Families and Criminal Justice on the telephone and told him that the recommendation from Deborah Wicks was that Niamh should be referred to the Open Unit. That information was not accurate. Douglas Dunlop did not ask who Niamh's social worker was. He did not ask to see the social worker's report nor the papers from the LAAC Review. He did not speak to anyone directly involved with Niamh's care. On the basis of what he had been told by Roger Wilson, Douglas Dunlop directed Roger Wilson to draw up an alternative plan for Niamh recommending one of Argyll and Bute's own children's homes. William Moore was the Accomodations Manager with Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the person responsible for identifying a potential suitable placement. A place was available at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Douglas Dunlop instructed that the alternative plan of </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> should be drawn up in the form of a supplementary report from Niamh's social worker containing that recommendation. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>53. As at the end of June 2009, the view of Deborah Wicks, Adah Lambie and Joy Daniels was that Niamh should move from the Secure Unit to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB>, prior to any further move. Adah Lambie, Deborah Wicks and staff at the Secure Unit thought that Niamh should remain in the secure unit until accommodation was available at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB>. None of this information was ever communicated to Douglas Dunlop. Had Douglas Dunlop been privy to the views of other professionals familiar with Niamh's case, specifically those of Deborah Wicks, he would have played no part in the decision-making process regarding Niamh's future placement. He would not have instructed Roger Wilson as he did had he known that Deborah Wicks was recommending that Niamh remain in secure accommodation, until such time as a place in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB> became available.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>54. An Argyll and Bute Resource Management Meeting was held in Inveraray on </span><span lang=EN-GB>29<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Its remit was to make decisions on community based packages of care. Discussion of Niamh's case was not on the agenda. After the formal part of the meeting, Niamh's case was discussed by Joy Daniels, William Moore , Placement Manager with Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and Alexander Taylor, Social Work Manager with Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>. None of these had seen any papers in relation to Niamh nor had any one of them spoken at any time to Deborah Wicks. They were aware of the involvement of Douglas Dunlop and the recommendation that a suitable place be found for Niamh within one of the children's units run by Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>. They decided that the recommendation of Argyll and Bute Social Work to the Children's Panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> should be that Niamh should go directly from the Secure Unit to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The discussion of Niamh's case without papers at the end of a Resource Management Meeting was unique. This was not the appropriate forum for such a discussion to have taken place nor for this kind of decision to have been made without the decision-makers having full information. No Minutes were taken at this meeting. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>55.

By that time the decision had been made by management at Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> that the recommendation to the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> was to be for accommodation at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>56.

When Deborah Wicks realised at the meeting on 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2009 that the recommendation to the panel was to be that Niamh be transferred from the Secure Unit to East King Street, she told Adah Lambie that she was refusing to attend the Children's Panel on 3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009 to put forward a recommendation with which she did not agree. She went on sick leave on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> after an accident at home.

She was told that Niamh would be going to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Colette Bysouth was very concerned that </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> would not be able to keep Niamh safe and expressed those concerns to Adah Lambie. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>59. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Adah Lambie took on the role of Niamh's social worker in the absence of Deborah Wicks. She remained in that role until Niamh's death. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>60. At the Children's Panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> the recommendation for </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> was made by Adah Lambie. The Panel followed that recommendation. On that date Niamh transferred to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Staff at the Secure Unit had not anticipated that Niamh would be leaving the unit that day. No paperwork went with Niamh when she moved. The only information available on Niamh was that given at the meeting on 2<sup>nd</sup> July. From the outset, Nancy Porter, Unit Manager at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, had concerns for Niamh's safety, particularly relating to the transfer from secure accommodation to a very open unit in the community where Niamh would have access to her peers. </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> was not equipped to accommodate any child who was a persistent self-harmer and/or in respect of whom there were issues in regard to a potential risk. Niamh was both. </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> was not appropriate accommodation for Niamh at that time. She should not have been transferred there on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>61.

Her bedroom walls were covered with large laminated photographs of Jonny McKernan, described by a member of staff as 'resembling a shrine'. She spoke often of her wish to 'be with Jonny'. She returned to the home under the influence of drink. On one occasion she brought alcohol into the home. On the morning of </span><span lang=EN-GB>27th July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she was found in bed in a semi-conscious state under the influence of some substance. After investigation it transpired that she had consumed a large quantity of Valium, with the intention of ending her life. She thought she had taken in excess of 90 tablets. It is likely that she had consumed around 20 before passing out. She told the staff on duty that she 'wanted to be with Jonny' and that she was angry that she had wakened up. She was staggering, and her speech was slurred. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>62. During the course of </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> despite her condition, Niamh absconded on two occasions from </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. On one occasion she was returned by the police and on the second occasion she was returned by a member of staff to whose house in Helensburgh she had gone. She was also seen by Dr. Fang and then by Dr. Brown, two local general practitioners. Neither was of the view that Niamh required to be seen at a hospital though Dr. Brown concluded that she 'may well have needed a psychiatric assessment'. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>63. Colette Bysouth spent much of </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She was due to go on holiday to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Spain</span><span lang=EN-GB> with the rest of her family the next day and wanted to cancel that. A ticket had been bought for Niamh. However she had </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>made it clear to her mother that she was not prepared to adhere to any restrictions on her behaviour while abroad. Collette Bysouth had reluctantly concluded that she could not risk Niamh absconding from her care in a foreign country and had decided prior to </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> that Niamh should not join the family holiday. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Collette Bysouth received assurances from Adah Lambie that Niamh would be accommodated in a safe respite facility in Ayrshire and that she should continue with her holiday plans. Had she not had that assurance, she would have cancelled the family holiday. Dr. Brown understood that Niamh was to be taken by social workers that same evening to a place of safety in the country. </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> could not keep Niamh safe.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>64. Despite the understanding of Colette Bysouth and Dr. Brown and the assurances given by Adah Lambie, Niamh remained at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> until </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th </sup>July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. That morning, an emergency meeting took place at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The meeting was attended by Roger Wilson, Joy Daniels, Adah Lambie and Anne Berry, a care worker at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The decision of the meeting was that Niamh should be transferred to the Open Unit on an emergency basis. Roger Wilson contacted William Moore by telephone and later that morning Paul Crombie, placement officer with Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> telephoned Sandy Cunningham who agreed to accept Niamh at the Open Unit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>65. After the meeting, when Anne Berry was helping Niamh to collect her belongings for her removal to the 0pen Unit, she found a suicide letter lying beside Niamh's bed. At that time Niamh had emptied out her belongings which had just been packed. Anne Berry saw the words 'Don't grieve for me' on the note and quickly put it in her pocket. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>66. Niamh was taken to the Open Unit, still in her night attire and with vomit stains on her clothes, by Anne Berry, a male careworker, who drove the car, and Veronica Mahoney, Acting Team Leader with Through Care Team, Argyll and Bute who had called into East King Street that morning on an unconnected matter and had volunteered to assist with Niamh's transfer. Adah Lambie did not accompany her, nor did any paperwork go with her. In the course of the car journey, Niamh said on several occasions that she wanted to be with Jonny. She tried to get out of the car. She said that if a young person wanted to run away from the Open Unit, she just had to go on to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Erskine</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB> because staff would not chase anyone there in case she jumped. She was in a state of considerable distress on her arrival at the Open Unit. Such was her distress that the staff from </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> who took her there had to leave eventually without her knowledge. Veronica Mahoney told staff at the Open Unit about Niamh's reference to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Erskine</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>67. At the Open Unit, in the course of Niamh's reception, Anne Berry gave the suicide note to Margory Thomson, a care worker at the Open Unit, who copied it and returned the principal to Anne Berry. That was the only document given to the Open Unit on Niamh's transfer there on </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Anne Berry took the principal back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Later that day in the course of a telephone call she read its contents to Adah Lambie and on Adah Lambie's instructions put the note in Niamh's </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> file where it remained unread by anyone until it was recovered by the police on </span><span lang=EN-GB>5<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>68. Between around </span><span lang=EN-GB>noon</span><span lang=EN-GB> and 1730 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>28th July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Sandy Cunningham became aware of the existence of the suicide note but did not ask to see it, nor did he discuss its contents with the social work department. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>69. The Open Unit was not equipped to accommodate any child at risk of suicide. As at </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh was at risk of suicide. She was not appropriately placed at the Open Unit on </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Niamh </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>- 28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>- 4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>70. During her time at the Open Unit until her death Niamh's key worker was Karen Kydd and her co-key worker was James Boyle.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>71. It was the responsibility of Adah Lambie to arrange for Niamh's case to go before a children's panel. Between 28<sup>th</sup> July and </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th </sup>October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> no such arrangement was made by her. The transfer of Niamh from </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Open Unit should have been considered and reviewed by such a panel with the necessary reports and information before it. That did not happen because of Adah Lambie's omission.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>72. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>29<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Sandy Cunningham went on annual leave. A meeting took place at the Open Unit that day attended by Liz Anne Davenport, the Deputy Head of Service at the Open Unit, and in the absence of Colette Bysouth, by Niamh's maternal aunt, Ashleigh Bysouth. At the meeting Lizanne Davenport told Ashleigh Bysouth about the suicide note. As the note was addressed to Niamh's mother, Ashleigh Bysouth was not permitted to read it.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>73. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>29<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> staff at the Open Unit were concerned about Niamh's continued presentation of drowsiness as a result of the overdose and she was taken to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Royal</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alexandria</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> where she was seen by Dr Fiona Brenna. She required no treatment. James Boyle, care worker at the Open Unit, accompanied Niamh. He had not been told about the suicide note. No further assessment was ordered by the doctor.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>74. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>30<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh absconded from the Open Unit and made her way to the Secure Unit. She was in a state of considerable distress and tried to get into the Secure Unit beyond the reception area. Staff from the Open Unit followed her. She had to be physically restrained before being taken back to the Open Unit. Shortly after her arrival there, she cut the inside of her left wrist with a razor. She was taken by James boyle to the Royal </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alexandria</span><span lang=EN-GB> He did not inform the doctor of the overdose of valium and was still unaware of the existence of the suicide note. Niamh's injury required 16 stitches.

She told the doctor of her concerns about Niamh's mental state and as a result a referral was sent by the doctor to CAHMS on </span><span lang=EN-GB>7<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.

She cried often but could also be positive on occasion. She made frequent references to wanting to be with her dead boyfriend and some members of staff at the Open Unit thought that she should be psychiatrically assessed. Niamh told her father during a telephone call that she was going to kill herself.

She was particularly concerned about </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s increasingly violent behaviour towards her and towards her sister and thought that a period of respite might alleviate the very difficult situation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>82. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> prior to Georgia and her sister leaving for school in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>, an argument in the family home over </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s use of hair-straighteners led to her assaulting her brother and having to be restrained. That same day Tanya Oliver saw the headmistress at Notre Dame, the secondary school in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> which </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> attended, and also had a long consultation with a locum General Practitioner in Ayrshire.

Tanya Oliver anticipated that this time apart from her family would be a period of respite for everyone involved and that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would be returned to her care very soon. She did not anticipate that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would be taken to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>84.

On that occasion </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> told Tanya Oliver that she could not wait to see her with blood coming out of her eyes, ears and mouth and that she wanted to see her dead. Social workers from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> took </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> away.

She stayed with them until </span><span lang=EN-GB>11<sup>th</sup> July 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB>.

The placement broke down as a result of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s persistent absconding, drinking and drug taking, and her high-risk sexual activity. The social work plan in July 2008 was to work towards </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s eventual return to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> after a period of time with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Postill. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>89.

The police were contacted and when she was traced, she was in a very drunken condition. She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. She was kicking and screaming and had to be held down by security guards. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> said that she wished she was dead. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>95.

That same day Lydia Jackson made arrangements for Georgia to be placed in secure accommodation at the Secure Unit at Levertonhall in Essex on a 72 hour Place of Safety Order.

She identified a variety of issues for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> which had to be addressed and recommended psychological therapy as essential if progress was to be made.

No one from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> visited the campus at Bishopton. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> had identified the Good Shepherd Centre from their website and had read the Care Commission Inspection Reports. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> did not consider any other residential establishment for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> at any time.

Thereafter her case was taken over by Dr. Lynsay Coxhall who prepared a report around the beginning of March 2009. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> did not engage fully with the preparation of this report. Dr. Coxhall's recommendation was that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> required psycho-therapy and she anticipated that at least a year would be needed for this work to be done with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>106.

Dr. Coxhall's report was available for that meeting. It was Dr. Coxhall's opinion and recommendation that if Georgia were to be moved from Sutton Place to the Secure Unit at Bishopton, then the transition had to be done slowly over a period of four months. She also recommended therapeutic work to assist </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> specifically with the transition process itself. The meeting agreed that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would remain at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB> for a further four months to prepare her for her anticipated transition and eventual transfer to the Secure Unit.

At the beginning of April 2009 Lydia Jackson was on leave. At that time, Roy Walker, manager of </span><span lang=EN-GB>sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Barbara Rutherfoord and Karen Robinson, Senior Social Worker, made a preliminary decision that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would transfer from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Secure Unit in Bishopton. No one from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB> or from the social work department contacted or attempted to contact Tanya Oliver to advise her of this change of plan. The terms of Dr. Coxhall's report were not taken into consideration when that decision was made nor was Dr. Coxhall contacted for advice either before </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s transfer to the Secure Unit or after her transfer either by those who took the decision or by any member of staff at the Secure Unit.

After that single overnight visit, the decision was taken that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would move to the Secure Unit on 17<sup>th</sup> April. Part of the rationale for that decision was that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> wanted to move, although she had been very distressed when she was told initially of the move. She was transferred to the Secure Unit on 21<sup>st</sup> April 2009. No therapeutic work was done either to assist any transition period nor in relation to the move itself. Dr. Coxhall was not told about Georgia's move on 21<sup>st</sup> April 2009 and when she did find out about it, was disappointed to discover that the move had been undertaken without any of her recommendations being acted on. On her return from China Tanya Oliver was advised of the imminent move, and visited </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB> the evening before her move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>111. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> remained at the Secure Unit until </span><span lang=EN-GB>24<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. After an initial settling-in period of around ten days when there were no difficulties, her behaviour deteriorated and there were a variety of outbursts from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> when she need to be restrained. During these times, she was agitated, tried to lash out at staff, and thrashed around. She was abusive, shouted and swore, refused to listen to staff, and squealed and made strange noises, described as 'animal-like'. Restraints lasted anywhere between ten and thirty minutes, and on one occasion she was restrained for forty five minutes. During these times, her eyes were closed and her hands sweaty. Afterwards she said she had no recollection of these outbursts nor any awareness of where she was during them. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>112. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>7<sup>th</sup> May 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> ripped up a pillowcase and put the ligature she had formed round her neck in an attempt to strangle herself. This was viewed by staff at the Secure Unit as a 'cry for help'. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>113. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th </sup>May 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> a Secure Accommodation Review was held at the Secure Unit. Various representatives from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> attended this meeting and reports were available from staff in the Secure Unit. The meeting concluded that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> continued to meet the criteria for secure accommodation. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>114. Jill Neil was one of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s care team at the Secure Unit. In a report dated </span><span lang=EN-GB>24<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she stated that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> continued to meet secure criteria. Further he opinion was that on </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>, the date of the next Secure Accommodation Review, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> continued to meet secure criteria. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>115. Sometime between 24<sup>th</sup> June 2009 and the end of July 2009 a decision was taken by Hull that Georgia should be moved from the Secure Unit to the Open Unit, and that no application would be made to Hull &amp; Holderness Family Proceedings Court for a further secure order. The order granted on </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> May 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> was due to expire on </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>116. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> a heated discussion took place between Tanya Oliver and Lydia Jackson at the Secure Unit during which Tanya Oliver expressed her serious concerns to Lydia Jackson about any proposed move for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> from the Secure Unit to the Open Unit.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>117. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>10<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Tanya Oliver received a letter from Lydia Jackson advising her that notwithstanding her concerns, the plan to move </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Open Unit would be implemented, prior to the expiry of the existing secure order on </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>118. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> a Secure Accommodation Review concluded that criteria for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s accommodation in secure facilities continued to be met. At the meeting Tanya Oliver was vocal in advising the meeting of her concerns about moving </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Open Unit. She expressed her opinion that none of the issues identified as being essential for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s progress had been addressed. She wanted </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to move to the Close Support Unit as a stepping-stone from secure to open conditions, when the time came that she no longer met secure criteria.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>119. A transition plan was worked out between Sue Ainley, Team Leader at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Lydia Jackson to accommodate </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s anticipated move from the Secure Unit to the Open Unit. This was the first time that such a transtion had taken place between these two units. Neither Sue Ainley nor Lydia Jackson visited the Open Unit prior to drawing up the transition plan and there was no discussion with the Open Unit as to where </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would be accommodated on her transfer there. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>120. At the start of the transition period on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> absconded from the Open Unit after another resident at the Open Unit AM had behaved aggressively towards her. Staff followed her to Bishopton, but she refused to return to the Open Unit. In Bishopton, she jumped repeatedly in front of moving vehicles. Staff were unwilling to attempt to take hold of her because of safety issues. They called the police. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was in considerable distress, making 'animal noises' and running into a garden. She had to be handcuffed before being taken back to the Secure Unit by the police. Staff at the Open Unit thereafter expressed serious concerns to management about the advisability of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s move to the Open Unit. Although in light of the events of 4<sup>th</sup> August 2009 the transition plan was revised slightly in that the date for the actual trasnfer was brought forward by three days, the decision to move Georgia from the Secure Unit to the Open Unit before the last secure order expired on 27<sup>th</sup> August 2009 was not changed.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>121. Between 23<sup>rd</sup> July and </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was visited by Tanya Oliver who thought that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had regressed.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>122. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was transferred to the Open Unit on </span><span lang=EN-GB>21<sup>st</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Her placement at the Open Unit at that time was not appropriate. She continued to meet the criteria for secure accommodation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> at the Open Unit</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>21st August 2009</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>- 4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>123. From August 2009 until her death, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was the victim of a sustained and increasingly violent campaign of bullying by another resident AM. The incidents of which staff became aware or witnessed were recorded in the Unit Log to which all staff had access. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>1st September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> when Liz Wilson a care worker at the Open Unit was told by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> of an incident that had happened on 31<sup>st</sup> August she reported the matter to Liz Anne Davenport. Management were aware from the outset of the escalating situation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>124. As a result of episodes of verbal intimidation and physical violence directed at her, described by a member of staff as being 'a daily occurrence', </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was frequently very upset and anxious. She absonded from the Open Unit on many occasions. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>125. She absconded on 7<sup>th</sup> September but did not leave the grounds. On 8<sup>th</sup> September when the girls were in the school, AM intimidated Georgia by hiding a pair of scissors in the waistband of her jeans but ensuring that Georgia knew the scissors were there. AM was excluded from the classroom. She was abusive to staff.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>126. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>8<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Liz Anne Davenport requested of and was granted additional funding by Fife Council, AM's placing authority, for additional funding to enable AM to be monitored and supervised on a one to one basis for a period of 5 to 6 days.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>127. On 9<sup>th</sup> September AM screamed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> and accused her of something which she had not done. On 10<sup>th</sup> September a further incident occurred when AM behaved in a threatening and aggressive manner to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>128. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>13th September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> when the girls were going to the swimming pool AM told </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> that when they got to the pool she was going to drown someone. The clear implication was that AM was going to try to drown </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was very upset and refused to go on the outing. When staff were made aware of the situation, AM became exceedingly aggressive and abusive towards them. She started to smash </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s bedroom window in 'the wee flat', shouting that she was going to kill her. It took staff approximately 45 minutes to contain AM and ensure her return to the building. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> absconded from the Open Unit and made her way to the Secure Unit, trying to get back in. She was returned by a member of staff. She was extremely distressed. This incident was reported to the police. Later that evening Georgia again left the Open Unit, saying that she was not going to remain in the unit for AM to stab her in the face with a piece of glass.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>129. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>15<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> AM accused </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> of having 'grassed' her for having 'hash' on 14<sup>th</sup> September. There was no truth in the accusation. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was intimidated by AM on this occasion.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>130.

She went to a house in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ferguslie</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Park</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Paisley</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She was returned to the Open Unit by the police at 0050 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>20<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>131. At approximately 2330 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday 25<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> placed items under her duvet to give the impression she was in bed, and absconded. She was returned to the Open Unit the next day by the police whom she had contacted. She had gone allegedly to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Greenock</span><span lang=EN-GB> to meet up with friends. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>132. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>26<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> AM threatened </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> and told staff that she would have put </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s head 'through a fucking window' if a certain member of staff (Karen Kydd) had not been working a long shift. Some 45 minutes later </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> absconded. On this occasion she met up with </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> a resident in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Both girls ran to the railway station at Bishopton and boarded the train for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>. They hung about the centre of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> and were then approached by an older man in a car who took them to a block of flats (location unknown). He gave them alcohol and drugs. Both became extremely intoxicated. They spent the night in the flat and during the night they had a conversation about committing suicide as neither girl thought that she had anything to look forward to in her life. </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> would have been too scared to kill herself but she thought that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was serious about wanting to die. </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> knew that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was being bullied by AM in the Open Unit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>133. The following morning (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>) at their request the unknown man drove them to Alloa, where </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> had family. He left them at the bus station and they subsequently went to the police. Standby Social Work were contacted and the two girls were taken back to their respective units at the Good Shepherd. In the course of the journey, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> expressed a desire to be back in the Secure Unit. She said she had felt safer there. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> said she did not want to go back to the Open Unit because of AM's bullying and because she was unhappy with the way staff were treating her. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>134. On arrival at the Open Unit, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> said to </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> that she would not see her again. </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> asked </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to promise that she 'wouldn't do anything stupid' but </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> refused to give her that promise. </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> told staff at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB> about this conversation. There was no evidence that this information was communicated to any one at the Open Unit.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>135. When </span><span lang=EN-GB>CMS</span><span lang=EN-GB> returned to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB> after this period of absconding, she was almost immediately thereafter transferred to the Secure Unit where she remained until April 2010.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>136. After </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s return on </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Karen Kydd, made an entry in the Unit Log that Georgia needed to be moved from 'the wee flat' to accommodation upstairs the following morning i.e. Monday 28<sup>th</sup> September. Karen Kydd had wanted the move to take place that evening as a matter of urgency, but other residents were angry with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> because she had absconded and it was not considered appropriate to make the move that evening. Sandy Cunningham agreed that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> should be moved out of 'the wee flat' the next day. He did nothing to ensure that his decision was acted upon and subsequently acquiesced when it was not. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>137. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was not moved from 'the wee flat'. Between 28<sup>th</sup> September and </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> no measures were put in place to address </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s increasing pattern of absconding, and high risk behaviour when she was at liberty. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>138. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was subjected to a prolonged period of bullying and intimidation by AM. On Tuesday 29<sup>th</sup> September Karen Kydd noted in the Unit Log that there were concerns about child protection issues in relation to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She contacted </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and advised them of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s continued threats to absond. Karen Kydd viewed the situation as untenable. Nevertheless no measures were put in place by management to end the bullying nor was any action taken by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> at that time. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>139.

She boarded the 1205 train from Bishopton to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>140. At around 0715 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>30<sup>th</sup> September 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> police at Maryhill contacted the Open Unit to advise that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had presented herself at Maryhill Police Office. Staff from the Open Unit collected her. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been away from the Open Unit for more than 20 hours.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>141.

She was advised that a new social worker had been appointed for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> and that it was intended she would visit the Open Unit with Lydia Jackson within possibly the next two weeks.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>142. In September 2009, staff at the Open Unit recognised that they could neither effectively contain AM nor keep </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> safe. When faced with a situation of sustained bullying resulting in frequent and high risk taking absonding over the month of September 2009, management at the Open Unit were complacent. No steps were taken to request AM's placing authority to remove her immediately nor was </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> contacted by management with a request that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> be moved from the Open Unit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>143.

Although since the age of 10 months until June 2008 </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had lived in family with her maternal aunt and two of her four half-siblings, she had for all of her life been subject to court orders and under the care of Hull City Council (formerly Humberside). From </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> until her death </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> remained in care at a variety of foster homes and residential establishments. As a result of these arrangements for both Niamh and Georgia, the Inquiry heard from many witnesses whose involvement ranged from the day-to-day care of the girls in residential establishments, to responsibility for management of such establishments.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Evidence was led from social workers, and management from both Argyll &amp; Bute and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB>. In additions, the Inquiry heard from psychologists, general practitioners, hospital doctors, and from Professor Platt, Professor of Health Policy at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>University</span><span lang=EN-GB> of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Edinburgh</span><span lang=EN-GB> who had prepared a report at the request of the Crown. The Inquiry heard evidence from Niamh's mother and her maternal aunt, and from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s maternal aunt who had looked after her for most of her life prior to June 2008. Given the breadth of the evidence before the Inquiry, I have attempted in what follows to focus on evidence in relation to the matters raised in the formal determination and to expand as appropriate on those matters in respect of which I have made Findings-in-Fact. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Although the Inquiry examined the lives of Niamh and Georgia in some detail, the determination under Section 6(1)c is restricted to two reasonable precautions which, had they been taken <u>as at 4<sup>th</sup> October 2009, </u>may have avoided the deaths of these young girls <u>on that day</u>. The matters which I have listed under Section 6(1)(e) relate broadly as to how Niamh and Georgia came to be in the Open Unit in October 2009 and also to specific issues e.g. the bullying of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> by AM, which arose during their accommodation there. Had different decisions been taken at earlier stages, it may have been that neither Niamh nor Georgia would have been accommodated in the Open Unit on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Indeed, it is perfectly possible that had other decisions been taken in relation to their time in care, they would never have met. The fact is however that they <u>did</u> meet, were living in 'the wee flat' at the same time, and on the evening of </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> chose to leave there and walk the three miles or so to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Erskine</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB>. After sitting briefly on top of the barrier on the west side of the bridge, facing away from the water, they linked arms and fell backwards into the water.

I had no hesitation, in light of all the evidence, in concluding that Niamh and Georgia were well aware of what they were doing, and the consequences for them. They chose on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> to take their own lives, although the reasons for doing so on that particular day, and together, will never be known. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The matters under Section 6 (1) (e) I consider both relevant and material, but without that necessary causal connection which is required for any matter to come within the ambit of Section 6 (1) (c).</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Some weeks after the conclusion of the evidence, I was provided with written submissions on behalf of all parties represented, with the exception of Miss Lydia Jackson.

However, I hope that any person reading this determination will be able to follow the particular sequence of events in the lives of Niamh and Georgia which led to the tragedy of </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I have covered what I consider the relevant issues in what I trust is sufficient detail to enable the reasoning behind my findings and conclusions to be understood.

She was the daughter of Colette Alison Bysouth and Paul Lafferty (also known as Paul Szeles). Her father died on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd </sup>September 2010</span><span lang=EN-GB> at his own hand. Niamh's parents separated when she was about 2. Part of their time together was spent in </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span lang=EN-GB>. For the next few years, Niamh stayed with her mother and remained in regular contact with her father and her paternal grandparents. Her mother formed another relationship, as a result of which Niamh has two half-sisters. Niamh lived in family with her mother, her step-father and her two sisters.  Niamh's mother was at all times a loving and concerned mother who always had her daughter's best interests at heart. Niamh had a close bond with her father and as she grew older was consistent in her wish to live permanently with him. At least part of her disruptive behaviour at home, at school and in the community had as its aim a desire for her mother to 'throw her out of the house'. Her mother was never prepared to do that. Niamh, whether in care or at home, could be difficult and demanding. She did not make life easy for those involved in her care. She could also be good company and fun. Niamh lived with her father between 2007 and 2008. In 2006, when she was at her father's house, she witnessed the aftermath of an extremely violent incident in which her father was repeatedly stabbed and ended up in intensive care, and another man Brian Fallon was killed. Paul Lafferty was subsequently tried for the murder of Brian Fallon and was acquitted. At the time Niamh was traumatised by what she had witnessed. That extremely violent incident and its aftermath (Niamh was cited as a Crown witness in her father's murder trial though in the event not called to give evidence) undoubtedly impacted on Niamh's future behaviour. It was unfortunately never properly investigated principally as a result of her failure to engage with any therapeutic work available to her. She became a friend of the daughter of the man whom her father had killed and she also started hanging about with a group of young people in Helensburgh who were known for drug taking, underage drinking, and generally delinquent behaviour.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>As well as being a man of violence, Paul Lafferty took illegal drugs, including heroin. He was never at any time able to provide the appropriate guidance to his daughter or establish boundaries for her behaviour. One stark example is his encouragement of his young daughter in her sexual relationship with Jonny McKernan who took drugs, was attracted to violence and had faced criminal charges. He was dismissive of Niamh's mothers concerns about the relationip. Although Colette Bysouth also had very serious and justified concerns about Paul Lafferty's ability to care for Niamh properly, she also recognised that Niamh loved her father and that her preference was to live with him, where the discipline was effectively non-existent and she would have the opportunities to live the lifestyle she wanted. Niamh's often expressed determination to live with her father was a matter to which unfortunately Argyll and Bute Social Work Department for a long time gave unjustified credence.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>When he came out of hospital in March 2009, having presented himself to the psychiatric unit on the day of Jonny McKernan's funeral, Paul Lafferty left </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> to live in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Denmark</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Niamh had telephone contact with him after that when she was in the Secure Unit, but no direct contact. It was a condition of her supervision requirement order that she had only supervised telephone contact with her father. The fact that shortly after March 2009 the decision was taken that Paul Lafferty was to have no direct contact with his daughter is eloquent of the wholly unrealistic assessment of his abilities as a father made by Argyll and Bute, during the course of 2008, and in particular when Adah Lambie recommended to the panel on 13<sup>th</sup> February 2009 that Niamh return to his care.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Niamh commenced her secondary education at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hermitage</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Academy</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Helensburgh in August 2006.

She was the fifth child of Mandy Oliver. The identity of her father is not known. Male twin half-siblings were adopted outwith the family. Her older half brother and older half sister were adopted by her maternal aunt Tanya Oliver prior to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s birth. In around the summer of 1995 Tanya who was married to Clarke Rowe at that time received a telephone call from Hull Social Work Department advising her of the existence of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> (then called Terrie). She did not hesitate to offer her a home. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>16<sup>th</sup> November 1995</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Kingston</span><span lang=EN-GB> upon Hull Family Court made a Care Order in respect of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> in terms of Section 31 of the Children Act 1989 in favour of Humberside County Council (predecessor of Hull City Council) and made an order authorising Humberside County Council to refuse contact between Georgia and her natural mother. Both orders remained in force at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. At the age of 10 months </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was placed in foster care under that order with Tanya and her husband who lived in Sorn, Ayrshire. This marriage was a second one for Tanya's husband and he had three children from his first marriage. Those three plus </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s half-brother and half-sister as well as Georgia all classed themselves as brothers and sisters. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Tanya and her husband separated in August 2002 and were subsequently divorced. They had been together for eighteen years, and the separation and the time which followed it was a difficult one for the whole family. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> took the separation badly as she had been very attached to her Dad and she tended to blame Tanya for the break-up of the marriage. It was Tanya's intention to adopt </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>, as she had her two half-siblings. Their natural mother had contested the adoptions and Tanya was anxious not to go through that difficult process (which had been resolved not that long before Tanya was told of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s existence) again. She wanted </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to arrange for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to be freed for adoption but, for reasons that never became entirely clear in the course of the inquiry, that did not happen. Certainly Tanya did not push for the adoption, and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> in turn took no legal action to change </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s status. However at home, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was treated no differently from her two half-siblings and she was loved and cared for by Tanya, and indeed other members of the extended family, often in very trying and difficult circumstances. As far as Tanya was concerned </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was her daughter. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>, like her brother and sister, was brought up in the knowledge of her origins and how she came to be with Tanya in Ayrshire. She knew that Tanya was not her birth mother. Georgia became aware for the first time that she had not been formally adopted by Tanya during the course of a meeting with a social work assistant in Hull when she was about seven. The assistant, without ascertaining beforehand what </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> knew of her origins or status, asked Tanya in the presence of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> whether she intended to proceed with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s adoption. The Inquiry heard evidence that on occasion </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> could be upset and angry that she had not been adopted. She was not averse however to telling professionals involved in her care and assessment that she had not known that Tanya was not her mother until she was older. It was clear that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been brought up in full knowledge of her origins and Dawn Lavain who worked with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> on her 'Life Story Book' gave evidence of how cooperative Tanya Oliver had been with this process, and how much information and material she had given to the exercise. There was also evidence that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> could be manipulative and be prepared to tell lies when she thought that might be to her advantage e.g. she told her foster-carers Mr. &amp; Mrs. Postill that unlike her sister she had not been sent to a private school, which did not accurately reflect the true situation. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> benefitted materially from the allowances which Tanya received for her from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She enjoyed many activities such as ski-ing, horse-riding and drama lessons, and as time passed with no movement on the adoption, it may well have suited Tanya Oliver to leave matters as they were. There was no evidence that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was treated differently from her brother and sister. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> attended primary school in Sorn. After the separation in 2002, her behaviour, which Tanya described as having always been 'a little different but nothing to worry about', changed. She started to tell lies and she went missing on a few occasions. At a young age she started to show an interest in boys. She commenced her secondary education at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Notre Dame</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>High School</span><span lang=EN-GB> in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> in August 2006.

She truanted from school, was violent and aggressive in her behaviour at home and was also sexually precocious. Complaints were received at her secondary school about her behaviour. Tanya sought and received support from social work staff at East Ayrshire Council throughout these difficulties. At different times, referrals were made to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) and Georgia and Tanya attended some appointments. East Ayrshire Council carried out their duties in respect of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> diligently and with care. They communicated information as appropriate to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Dawn Lavain in particular provided support and assistance to both Tanya and Georgia when appropriate. She was aware of how difficult and challenging </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s behaviour could be and was worried about the aggression being shown by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to Tanya and to her sister in particular. Dawn Lavain described Georgia's increasingly difficult behaviour as resulting in Tanya, who was working full-time and did not always enjoy the best of health, being 'at the end of her tether'. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>A crisis point was reached in June 2008.

No explanation was given to the Inquiry as to why such a transfer did not take place. It is unfortunate that no steps were taken by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to transfer responsibility. East Ayrshire Council were 'on the doorstep' and throughout had provided a high standard of care and commitment to Tanya and Georgia.

Had such a transfer taken place, then </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would never have gone to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> - a move which it was accepted by Lydia Jackson and was clear from the evidence was an unmitigated disaster for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The Inquiry heard evidence that no suitable foster placement was available in Ayrshire in the middle of June 2008, but the Inquiry was also advised that Mr. and Mrs. Chippendale, the foster-carers in Jedburgh, could have kept </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> for two weeks.

The move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> in June 2008 may have been taken initially on a misunderstanding of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s connections with the area, though it is hard to know how that could have happened, given the long involvement </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> had had with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s care.

However, within a short period of time, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> should have re-assessed the situation, especially when the first foster placement in the area broke down so quickly. Lydia Jackson was aware at the time that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was being moved from what she described as a 'high-end' lifestyle to inner-city living and inner-city opportunities for alcohol/drug abuse and meeting up with delinquent young people. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> also became aware in the summer of 2008 that somehow </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had managed to make contact with her birth mother - something that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> had not wanted to happen for thirteen years.

Almost immediately however it became apparent that she could not be kept safe there, given her links to a group of young people in Helensburgh who tried to 'get her out' of the home. She was therefore moved to the Open Unit where she remained until February 2009. During that time, Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s long term plan for Niamh was that she be returned to the care of her father. At best, the social work department had a totally over-optimistic view of his capabilities. Given the evidence heard, it is exceptionally difficult, if not impossible, to understand the thinking which led to the belief that Paul Lafferty was ever going to be a suitable carer for his young daughter. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There is no doubt that Niamh had a very strong and often expressed wish to stay with her father but at no time did Argyll &amp; Bute Social Work Department carry out a risk assessment in relation to Paul Lafferty. That might have been a sensible starting point and had they carried out such an assessment, it would have been clear to them at a much earlier stage than February 2009 that he was not and was never going to be a suitable carer for his teenage daughter. By the time of the Family Conference in November 2008 on which too much weight seems to have been placed by the social work department (it was no more than a 'round the table' meeting of those with an interest in Niamh's welfare), it should have been obvious to the social workers that Paul Lafferty should no longer have been considered as a potential carer for Niamh. Although on occasion he would attend meetings and 'say the right things', there were many times when he did not attend appointments, and at the Family Conference in November 2008 there was at least the suggestion that he was under the influence of drugs. The social work department were well aware of his background and his behaviour, and yet they persisted in considering him as a potential carer in their plans for Niamh. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Sandra Leonard impressed as a thoughtful and caring social worker who recognised in her evidence the unsuitability of Paul Lafferty as a carer for his daughter. She accepted that he had never been someone who would have been a suitable carer for his daughter. It is unfortunate that at the time when she was working with Niamh she had not been able to 'take a step back' from the situation and appreciate the reality of Paul Lafferty's lifestyle, personality and commitment to his daughter. When faced with Niamh's determination to live with her father, she gave undue weight to the wishes of the young person and not sufficient weight to the realities of the situation. There were several examples of witnesses placing far too much emphasis on what either Niamh or Georgia wanted, rather than exercising their own professionalism by carrying out a proper assessment of a situation. Sandra Leonard acknowledged that 'Colette was very much a constant, she had a very good working relationship (with the Social work Department) and was very committed to her daughter's wellbeing...' It was Niamh's return to the care of Colette that the social work department should have been working towards. If that was not going to be a possibility because of Niamh's determination to live with her father, then the only option was for Niamh to remain in care until she was old enough to live independently. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Nevertheless, the plan at the beginning of 2009 was for Niamh's eventual return to the care of her father. Before that could happen, Sandra Leonard had identified necessary supports to help Niamh's anticipated placement and was well-aware that these had to be in place prior to any move being made. She had discussed them with her senior Adah Lambie and had also communicated her recommendation that the move to her father should proceed via a time spent at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>.

The essential supports which had been identified by her as having to be available before there could be any move by Niiamh to live with her father and which she had discussed with her senior had not been put in place. Adah Lambie was well aware of what Sandra Leonard considered essential before any move from the Open Unit could happen. Colette Bysouth who attended the hearing on </span><span lang=EN-GB>13<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> gave evidence that Paul Lafferty who was also present told Adah Lambie prior to the meeting that he was not ready to care for Niamh at that time. Even Paul Lafferty seems to have recognised that he was not fit to look after Niamh. Despite this, and despite being aware that no supports were in place, Adah Lambie went into the meeting and recommended that Niamh be returned to the care of her father. This wholly unsatisfactory situation was made worse by the fact that there was confusion between the Open Unit and the Social Work Department about when the order made by the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>13<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> was to commence. Unfortunately, due to lack of communication, no one took it upon himself/herself to try to find out when the move was to take place and Niamh left the hearing with her father, and without any supports to assist them. . Sandra Leonard was very surprised indeed on her return from holiday to discover that the move had been recommended and made without the 'very very intensive phased transition'; which she had contemplated. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(b) 13<sup>th</sup> February until </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Colette collected Niamh from her father's house on </span><span lang=EN-GB>18<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> to go to the LAAC review.

On </span><span lang=EN-GB>19<sup>th</sup> February 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> at a planning meeting in Helensburgh, the decision was taken that Niamh should return to the Open Unit. When Niamh was advised of this decision by telephone by her father, she ran away when her mother went to collect her to take her to the Open Unit. She finally agreed to go with her mother to the Open Unit, but only after she had said 'goodbye' to her boyfriend Jonny McKernan. Two days later Jonny McKernan died of a drugs overdose and Niamh was overcome with grief and loss. Up until she died, she continued to grieve for her dead boyfriend and repeatedly expressed the wish to be with him, by which she meant that she wanted to be dead, not simply that she missed him. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Niamh attended the funeral on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> and consumed both alcohol and drugs. Her father, having threatened to kill himself with a knife, was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Vale of Leven hospital that same day. Niamh had to be returned to the Open Unit by police. Thereafter she started to abscond from the Open Unit. She blamed her mother for the death of Jonny and she was upset that her father was in hospital. She was depressed and was without doubt in a state of crisis. An emergency panel sat on </span><span lang=EN-GB>13<sup>th</sup> March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> which continued Niamh's supervision requirement of the Open Unit. Shortly after the hearing, Niamh absconded from the Open Unit and remained at large for the whole weekend. She returned to the Open Unit on Monday 16<sup>th</sup> March and was transferred to the Secure Unit on a 72 hour order. Her accommodation in the Secure Unit was confirmed by a subsequent panel and Niamh remained in secure accommodation until </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Secure accommodation was clearly the right place for Niamh between March and July 2009. She coped well with the secure regime and her times of mobility, although always closely supervised, caused no difficulties. However she refused to participate in any psychological therapy and although she completed a programme about the dangers of alcohol and drugs, her participation was merely superficial. She repeatedly told staff in the Secure Unit that whenever she had the opportunity, she would be 'getting mad with drink and drugs' again. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The aims of the secure placement had been five fold:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>1. to provide a nurturing environment with consistent age appropriate boundaries and routines</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>2. for Niamh to build trusting relationships with maternal family and other appropriate adults to enable her to explore her emotions in a safe and secure place.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>3. to explore Niamh's loyalty to her paternal family and peer group and assist her to develop realisitc expectations in relation to contact with same</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>4. to address Niamh's alcohol and drug misuse and assist Niamh to develop strategies to keep herself safe in the community</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>5. to provide opportunity for Niamh to explore her feelings of attachment and loss and assist in developing more positive relationships with others</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>By </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> only the first aim had been achieved, and that effectively 'came with the territory'. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The fact that Niamh had been placed in secure accommodation in March 2009 demonstrated how serious the situation had been.

It was also never explained why she chose to do nothing in response to Anne Berry reading to her the contents of the suicide note other than to instruct that it should be filed. She failed to treat the contents of the letter and the whole incident as seriously as she ought to have done. Had she done so, then Niamh at the end of July 2009 would have been identified as the suicide risk that she clearly was, and would not have been accommodated in the Open Unit, an establishment which was neither equipped for nor had staff appropriately trained to deal with a young person in Niamh's critical state.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>e. Despite her evidence to the Inquiry that as at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh continued to meet secure criteria, she attended the panel that day and put forward the recommendation that Niamh should be transferred to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Why she should have recommended one thing while holding a different view was never explained. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>f. There was a dispute in the evidence as to the circumstances in which Deborah Wicks did not attend the panel meeting on 3<sup>rd</sup> July. Deborah Wicks had an accident at home on the morning of 3<sup>rd</sup> July as a result of which she was off work for many weeks. She told the Inquiry that she had informed Adah Lambie on </span><span lang=EN-GB>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> that she was refusing to attend the hearing on 3<sup>rd</sup> July. Adah Lambie said that conversation had not taken place. However, I preferred her evidence on the disputed matter and am satisfied that she told Adah Lambie that she was not prepared to attend a panel to put forward a recommendation with which she did not agree. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It is difficult to undestand in the face of all the evidence pointing towards a different recommendation why Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB> chose to recommend to the panel on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> that Niamh should transfer straight from the Secure Unit to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. They were fully aware of all the background and of the dangers and temptations available for Niamh within the community. Naimh herself had repeatedly and without equivocation expressed her intentions in relation to drugs and alcohol to staff within the Secure Unit. Niamh was an absconder, a self-harmer and a young girl who had repeatedly expressed her wish to be dead. She had undergone no therapeutic work to address her attachment to her father, her bereavement after the death of Jonny or her determination not to live with her mother. She had not been tested in the community. The three social workers involved at the time i.e. Deborah Wicks, Adah Lambie and Joy Daniels all gave evidence to the Inquiry that Niamh as at 3<sup>rd</sup> July continued to meet secure criteria. Had there been proper communication among all those involved in this decision-making process, then one can conclude with confidence that Niamh would never have been transferred straight from the Secure Unit to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Had staff autonomy, on which Douglas Dunlop told the Inquiry he placed such importance, been allowed to play its proper part, then the recommendations of Deborah Wicks would have been given their proper weight. In addition, had Joy Daniels felt confident in her autonomy, then at the Inveraray meeting she might not have allowed herself to be persuaded by Alex Taylor and William Moore against her better judgement to accede to the instruction from Douglas Dunlop that the panel was to have a supplementary report recommending </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>In the course of their evidence, social workers emphasised that the decisions made at the Children's Hearings were panel decisions and of course that is correct. However, panel members rely on receiving comprehensive information from social work departments and it would be disingenuous to suggest that panel members are not influenced in their decision-making by the recommendations put to them by those with direct involvement in the care of an individual child, and who in their professional capacity are taken to be fully informed as to all the circumstances.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Because of its pivotal role in Niamh's transfer to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> on 3<sup>rd</sup> July, it is important to appreciate that the decision-making nature of the meeting which took place after the Resource Management Meeting at Inveraray was unique. According to Mark Lines, Social Work Aanager, Argyll and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bute</span><span lang=EN-GB>, it was not the appropriate forum for such a discussion. Three senior managers were prepared to take a decision in the absence of any papers, and in a situation in which there could therefore be no proper analysis of Deborah Wick's recommendations. The point made by Mr. Gilbride, Counsel for Colette Bysouth, is well founded - the meeting became in effect a contest between the Open Unit and an Argyll and Bute resource with a support package, done in a vacuum with no papers and no discussion whatsoever, as Joy Daniels told the Inquiry, of the contents of Deborah Wick's report. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>All of this arose apparently out of inaccurate information being communicated by Roger Wilson to Douglas Dunlop. Given the information that he had, Douglas Dunlop based his instruction at least in part on financial considerations and it is recognised that decisions concerning the best use of resources are at the best of times difficult ones. Given the fine balancing called for, it would have made sense for Douglas Dunlop to have satisfied himself that he had given proper consideration to the competing alternatives and for him to have done that he should have asked to see the available papers, and also spoken to Deborah Wicks. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Roger Wilson did not give evidence to the Inquiry. He left to live in </span><span lang=EN-GB>New Zealand</span><span lang=EN-GB> around a week prior to the commencement of the Inquiry. A request was made for him to provide affidavit evidence, as others have done, in which certain matters could have been addressed, but no response was received from him in this connection. The Inquiry therefore had only Douglas Dunlop's version of the telephone call from Roger Wilson and its contents. I had no difficulty in holding Douglas Dunlop credible on that matter and was satisfied that I could rely on his evidence as to what he had been told by Roger Wilson.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There is one other matter in relation to the decision taken on </span><span lang=EN-GB>29<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Ted Jeffries the psychologist who knew Niamh was present at the Resource Management meeting when Niamh's case was first raised. He told the Inquiry that he had voiced his opposition to a move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. He was the only person in Inveraray who had been at the LAAC Review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>15<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Unfortunately, he did not ensure that his opposition was minuted, and there is no reference to his views in the note prepared by Alex Taylor after Niamh's death. Ted Jeffries regretted this omission, but in fairness to him, the Inquiry heard of many instances of proceedings at meetings not being minuted, of minutes containing inaccuracies, as fundamental as not noting correctly who attended them, and of minutes being prepared but not circulated for approval. Some failures in communication can be crucial. However, there was nothing to suggest that the decision of </span><span lang=EN-GB>29<sup>th</sup> June 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> would have been different had Ted Jeffries' opposition been more vociferous or had his opposition been minuted. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(c) </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> to </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Niamh moved from the Secure Unit to </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Initially she was kept on a very tight lead. She had contact with her mother and the rest of the family and to begin with there were no major difficulties. She had additional support from Sylvia Rennie of Up 2 Us. Her room at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> was full of large laminated photographs of Jonny . Within a short time however Niamh started to strain against the restrictions placed on her movements and on her contacts. She found a part-time job in a local caf which concerned Sylvia Rennie greatly as it meant that Niamh would have access to cash. Niamh candidly told her that she was going to spend all the money and 'have a party'. During her short time at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> she tried to bring alcohol into the home on one occasion and she also returned under the influence on another. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>She continued to express her wish to be with Jonny and at least one member of staff took these expressions as evidence of suicidal intentions. The member of staff did not however enter these in the appropriate log. On the morning of </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh was found in her bed in a semi-conscious state. She was incoherent and later seen bouncing from one wall in a corridor to another. Staff realised that she was under the influence of drugs and took appropriate action. She was seen by Dr. Fang and Dr. Brown, two general practitioners during the course of the day. Her mother spent most of 27<sup>th</sup> July at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Adah Lambie also attended. During </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> Niamh repeatedly said to those in attendance that she wanted to be with Jonny and she told Dr. Fang that she would not understand why she was still alive. Despite this information, Dr. Fang did not ask Niamh why she took the tablets, nor did he think of referring Niamh to CAMHS. Dr. Brown, like Dr. Fang, did not think it necessary that Niamh attend Accident and Emergency. He did conclude however that she may well have needed psychiatric assessment. He told the Inquiry that there were great difficulties in having a child between the ages of 14 and 16 admitted to a psychiatric unit, given the limited number of beds available in the area. He described </span><span lang=EN-GB>Gartnavel</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Royal</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> as being under huge pressure because of having only a small number of beds for that age-group. He had attended </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> in the evening and as CAMHS runs a </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 to 5</span><span lang=EN-GB> service, that option was not available at the time either.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>He considered that </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> could not keep Niamh safe. However, he was privy to the discussions about where Niamh should go and when he left the home sometime later, he was under the impression that Niamh would be moving that night to a more secure place in the country. That was the same impression that Colette Bysouth was given by Adah Lambie, as a result of which she somewhat reluctantly decided to continue with her holiday plans with the rest of the family. Had she not thought that Niamh was being moved that night to a safe place in Ayrshire, she would not have gone on holiday the next morning. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Niamh did not go to Ayrshire. She remained overnight in </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> and was taken in a state of considerable distress to the Open Unit late on the morning of </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The decision to move Niamh to the Open Unit was taken by Roger Wilson at a meeting convened at </span><span lang=EN-GB>East King Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> earlier that morning. William Moore was contacted by telephone by Roger Wilson who made no mention of there having been a suicide attempt. Following on that, Paul Crombie phoned Sandy Cunningham who agreed to accommodate Niamh. Apparently no consideration was given at the meeting as to whether Naimh's overdose might have been a suicide attempt. No one asked the simple question 'Was this a suicide attempt?' That omission I consider extraordinary. Had the question been asked and answered correctly in the light of all the available information, then the Open Unit would not have been considered as an appropriate placement for Niamh. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Later that day, a further opportunity presented itself to the professionals responsible for Niamh's care and her safety when the existence of the suicide note was made known to both Sandy Cunningham and Adah Lambie.

Why Sandy Cunningham did not read the note nor act on it was never made clear. He was very reluctant in his evidence to accept that the note was a suicide note (see later in this note). Why Adah Lambie also did nothing in response to learning of the note's existence and its contents, other than to tell Anne Berry to file it is beyond my understanding. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(6) Recommendations made and Decisions taken by </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>City</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> Council in relation to </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(a) </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>No explanation was given as to why no consideration was given by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the transfer of responsibility for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> if not in the early stages to Strathclyde Regional Council, then at a later stage to East Ayrshire Council. By 2008 </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> for 13 years. It must have been clear to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> that the adoption of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> by Tanya Oliver for whatever reason was not going to proceed. A freeing order could have been applied for in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> had the case been transferred. The supervision of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was being done by social workers in Ayrshire who were having to communicate with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Looking at the situation from a purely logistical standpoint, a transfer should have been proceeded with. There seems to have been some confusion in the minds of the social work department in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> as to what the legal possibilities and procedures might be if the matter were to have been raised in a Scottish court. There was nothing to prevent </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> from drawing their long and geographically distant responsibility for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to an end. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(b) </span></b><span lang=EN-GB></span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> acted prematurely in removing </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>24<sup>th </sup>June 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB>. While there was on that date no foster placement available in East Ayrshire, there was evidence that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> could have remained with the foster carers in Jedburgh for two weeks, which would have allowed other options to be explored. Other reasons for the move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> were that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> wanted to go to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that there was family in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> who might be able to offer a home/support to Geogia. There was no considered response to the crisis situation which had developed. No consultation took place with Tanya Oliver, who in the initial days after </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s removal from Ayrshire, was not kept informed by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> as to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s whereabouts. This information was communicated to her in text messages from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. In the light of her long commitment to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>, that is an extraordinary position for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to have adopted. The move took </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> from a rural area to an urban one, involved a change of school and two foster placements in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> which broke down. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was able to contact her natural mother and she had the opportunity to fall in with 'the wrong crowd' in the neighbourhoods in which her foster placements were. It is not possible to state with any confidence that a move within </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> would necessarily have had a better outcome, but the fact is that the move to </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span lang=EN-GB> was a disaster for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She derived no benefit from it and her behaviour deteriorated. Lydia Jackson candidly accepted that disaster was an accurate description, and that was not challenged. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(c)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> Initially </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> were under the impression that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had family contacts in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> area who might have been able to provide care for her. It was never made clear on what that thinking was based. However, within a very short period of time </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> knew that no such supports/connections existed. The plan in the summer of 2008 by which time </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was living with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Postill was to get </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> and returned eventually to Tanya Oliver. By that time </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was absconding regularly, taking alcohol and drugs, and involving herself in high risk sexual behaviour. These incidents were all reported to the social work department who must have realised that the opportunities for high risking taking behaviour and absconding had multiplied on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s arrival in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> area. Georgia had also, despite the terms of the court order that there was to be no contact between her and her mother without the agreement of the social work department, made contact with Mandy Oliver. Mandy Oliver had chronic addiction issues and had been unable to care for any one of her 5 children. The social work department became aware of this contact. The Inquiry heard no evidence of any action taken by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> which stopped this contact, prior to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> being taken into secure accommodation. Mandy Oliver had played no part in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s life for almost 13 years. She chose not to attend the Inquiry of which she had been made aware. While at first </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was keen to establish some kind of relationship with her natural mother, she realised soon after establishing contact that her mother could offer her nothing. That must have been a severe disappointment to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> at a time of such upheaval in her young life. Mr. Pollock on behalf of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> submitted that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s behaviour had stabilised during her time with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Postill and that it deteriorated only when they went on holiday. The evidence did not support that submission. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was drinking, indulging in high risk sexual activity and taking drugs on occasion before the holiday in September 2008. The fact that Mr &amp; Mrs. Postill's daughter Rebecca Blampney was prepared to shoulder the responsibility for Georgia while her parents were on holiday, and the fact that the Postills were willing to have Georgia back with them after she had been admitted to Merlin Bridge says much about their willingness to shoulder a continuing responsibility to Georgia and is very much to their credit. There was however no stabilisation in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s behaviour from the day she left Ayrshire till the day she went into secure accommodation at the end of October 2008. Rather, the opposite was the case. Her behaviour deteriorated and her risk-taking increased.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(d)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> During her brief stay at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Merlin Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was able to abscond regularly and also have contact with her natural mother.

The Secure Unit was identified as a possibility and arrangements were made for a meeting in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Newcastle</span><span lang=EN-GB> on an unspecified date. The Secure Unit had advantages i.e. there was a Close Support Unit and an Open Unit on the campus, it was near to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s home, and apparently it had contacts with suitable foster homes (though apart from a passing reference, this last advantage was not explored in the evidence).

This gives the opportunity of proving (sic) (</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB>) with a model of a "good ending" rather than an experience of - as she may perceive it - abrupt separation/rejection. This may involve gradual steps such a staff from the identified placement making contact - telephone and visits - with (Georgia) and likewise (Georgia) having the opportunity to visit the placement with Sutton Place staff. Gradual exposure may reduce her anxieites and make the idea of moving less scary in her mind. I would also recommend time limited therapeutic work on helping (Georgia) manage and explore her feelings around the transition, and developing more helpful coping techniques to deal with the anxieties/negative thoughts that may well arise.

The remaining residents had to be accommodated elsewhere and the atmosphere within the home was no doubt unsettled as a result of the uncertainties for both staff and young people. Nevertheless more time was available for the transition of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the Secure Unit to have been paced. This was </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s ninth move since June 2008. Change of any sort can be difficult for anyone. For someone with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s history and difficulties, as Dr. Coxhall pointed out, change can be particularly traumatic. Given the very clear recommendations set out in Dr. Coxhall's recent report, it would have been of benefit to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> if more time had been taken over the move and in the light of those recommendations it is difficult to understand why the move took place when it did. In addition, there was no discussion with Tanya Oliver prior to her leaving on her trip to </span><span lang=EN-GB>China</span><span lang=EN-GB> about the possibility of an early move, and there was no effort made to contact her when the decision was taken that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> would be moving. She was therefore not involved in this decision. Nor was there any attempt by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to look at other possible placements for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>. As Barbara Rutherfoord so succinctly put it - there was no Plan B. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>No one in authority from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sutton Place</span><span lang=EN-GB> visited the Secure Unit prior to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s move there nor as it transpired did any social worker from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> responsible for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s care take the trouble to inspect either the Secure Unit or the Open Unit.

After some time however there were improvements but during all the time in the Secure Unit, no meaningful therapeutic work was undertaken and there remained concerns about </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s ability to cope outwith a secure environment. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(h) </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>When a secure order is made in respect of an individual child, there is a legal requirement for a review within 28 days. In </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s case, the first review took place on </span><span lang=EN-GB>27<sup>th</sup> November 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> following on the court order of </span><span lang=EN-GB>31<sup>st</sup> October 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB>.

At the review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> at the Secure Unit it was the general view of the meeting that although </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had made some progresss, secure criteria continued to be met. Physical holds were still necessary on occasion and there remained what are referred to as 'behaviour management issues' to be addressed. In spite of that assessment, a transition plan devised by Sue Ainley and Lydia Jackson, after discussion with Liz Anne Davenport, was commenced shortly thereafter. No transition plan involving a move from Secure to Open conditions had ever been prepared or attempted in relation to any other child. What was planned for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> therefore was unique and required monitoring with the utmost care, given </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s history of absconding and risk-taking. Further, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been in secure conditions since the end of october 2008 and her ability to cope outwith conditions of the utmost security had not been tested in any way. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(i)</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> Taking all of what is contained in <b>(h) </b>there was a very strong argument for an application by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the court for a further secure order towards the end of August 2009. Such an order is 'permissive' in nature and had a further order for another 3 months been sought and granted in August 2009, this would have allowed for testing of Georgia in conditions of less security and would have allowed Hull the opportunity of taking up some of the recommendations in Dr. Coxhall's report which had been effectively ignored up until July 2009. There was no analysis of how </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> might cope with yet another move nor was there any assessment or analysis of what progress had in fact been made by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> between </span><span lang=EN-GB>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> when she still met secure criteria and </span><span lang=EN-GB>21<sup>st</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> when she apparently no longer did. The person who made the decision that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> no longer met secure criteria in August 2009 was Karen Robinson, Sue Ainley's Line Manager, but there was no evidence as to the reasoning behind that decision. Barbara Rutherfoord in November 2008 assessed that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s stay in secure accommodation would not be short-term. In April 2009 </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been transferred to a different establishment at very short notice, without any therapeutic work to assist her. In July 2009, despite the fact that she had been assessed as continuing to meet the necessary criteria, she was going to be moved yet again, without any therapeutic work. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(j) </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>There was a failure on the part of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to recognise that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> had not been prepared properly nor tested for the amount of freedom she would have at the Open Unit. During her transition period </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> went on two outings, had tea at the Open Unit on two occasions and spent a total of ten nights at the Open Unit. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she absconded from the Open Unit and had to be returned to the Secure Unit in handcuffs. Despite that, and the views of members of staff in the Open Unit, particularly Karen Kydd, that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was not ready for transfer to open conditions, the transition plan was allowed to continue, with only minor amendment to the practicalities. With her history of absconding, risk-taking and self-harm, and strange behaviour which required restraints, and in the latest episode police assistance and the use of handcuffs, it should have been obvious to Hull that a move from conditions of 24 hour security to an open unit where the only form of security was 'staff vigilance' was not appropriate for Georgia at that time. That finding is based not on hindsight, but on what was known of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s history, her behaviour while in the Secure Unit and the events of </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB>. At the very least, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> should have put the transition on hold and gone to the court at the end of August for a further secure order. Such an order is permissive, so that if during the three month period thereafter </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> no longer met secure criteria, then she could have been moved at that stage. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>21<sup>st</sup> August 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> she continued to meet secure criterion in relation to absconding and given her behaviour in Bishopton, there is a sound argument that she also met the criterion in relation to risk/harm. Tanya was particularly concerned about the proposed move from secure to open conditions. She would have preferred that consideration be given to accommodation in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>CSU</span><span lang=EN-GB> as a stepping stone, but her concerns were overridden. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(k) </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>There was a failure on the part of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hull</span><span lang=EN-GB> to appreciate the nature and intensity of the bullying by AM and the high risk nature of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s absconding behaviour.

Both had spent time in secure accommmodation. The Open Unit in August 2009 accommodated also AM, a girl whose behaviour was aggressive, threatening and violent towards </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>, as well as abusive and intimidating towards the other girls.

Niamh and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s absconding on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4<sup>th</sup> October 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> had of course the worst of consequences.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Young persons in the Open Unit could not be locked in, and could be physically restrained only under certain very limited conditions.

For example, Mary Stewart thought that </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was to be monitored regularly when she was in 'the wee flat', as she was on 4<sup>th</sup> October, but that evening only Martha Fraser was in the building and was not in a position to monitor </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> properly.

The system allocated a colour to each child i.e. red, amber, green, with red being the most serious category of absconding behaviour. If two girls absconded together, the incident was coded according to the more serious category. This system was not preventative. It was a reactive measure by ensuring that whenever the absconding was identified, Open Unit staff alerted the police and the type of absonding was categorised by means of this colour-coding. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There were two types of absconding: (1) when a child on leave failed to return at the agreed time from time out or home leave and (2) when a child left the Open Unit without permission.

If a child coded 'red' absconded with another child, regardless of the second child's personal coding, the incident would be coded 'red'.

Sandy Cunningham in July 2009 authorised that the fire-door alarm be de-activated. The Inquiry heard no evidence of any attempt by management to tackle the problem of unauthorised use in a way which would have ensured that the fire-door remained alarmed.

In relation to Georgia, some limited information was available about where she might have gone on the various occasions when she absconded from the Open Unit, but even by the end of September 2009 there was no evidence of any structured approach being taken by staff to find out if the bullying by AM contributed to Georgia's absconding (given some of the things which Georgia had said, that could not have been in doubt), nor was there any attempt to carry out a proper risk assessment to determine the Open Unit's ability to keep Georgia safe. Management was aware of the high risk situations into which </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was putting herself and effectively did nothing. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The levels of absconding at the Open Unit were never raised with the Board of Management in terms of any report and Sandy Cunningham gave evidence that the issue of absconding did not merit greater consideration than it was given in 2009.

I do not agree with that submission. Georgia had a long and worrying history of absconding. As far as her stay at the Open Unit was concerned, the evidence was that the frequency of her absconding was increasing and the level of risk-taking escalating. No inference to support a proposition of modification of her absconding over time can be drawn.

Despite both girls having been in secure accommodation only weeks before they were placed in the wee flat, no assessment seems to have been made by staff in the Open Unit as to the suitability of puttng the girls in 'the wee flat' together.

I want to be clear that there is no criticism of either Mary Stewart or Martha Fraser in what either did or did not do that particular evening. I was impressed by both women and by the many years each had devoted in their working lives to looking after difficult and troubled girls.

Karen Kydd, Senior Care Worker, had a close relationship with AM - in her own words 'I wore her like a scarf. If I kept her with me, I knew she was not getting into bother.' There is no doubt that her special relationship with AM went some way in preventing difficult situations arising. However, there was evidence that this relationship blinkered Karen Kydd to the reality of the bullying situation and it was with considerable reluctance and only at a very late stage in her evidence, that she finally accepted that there <b>had</b> been bullying.

In his evidence he appeared sanguine about that time-tabling, despite his evidence that he was becoming increasingly concerned for the physical security of Georgia. His evidence never explained that contradiction. He accepted that he could simply have told Fife Council to remove AM forthwith from the Open Unit, but he did not do that. In the course of his evidence he described Georgia as a 'resilient character' whom he did not think was 'overly intimidated' by AM's bullying. How he could have come to that view is, in the face of all of the evidence about the bullying and its effect on Georgia, beyond comprehension. In the course of giving evidence, Sandy Cunningham gave the distinct impression that he was seeking to minimise the extremely serious nature of the bullying that was going on, more or less on a daily basis, in the establishment for which he held overall management responsibility. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Liz Anne Davenport in September 2009 knew that AM was no longer appropriately accommodated in the Open Unit but did not take steps to have her removed.

Her mother found the letter, considered its contents 'very worrying' and handed it into the Social Work Department in Helensburgh. Thereafter it disappeared. Sandra Leonard never saw it during the time that she was Niamh's social worker and the letter was neither contained in nor referred to in any of the voluminous paper work generated by Argyll &amp; Bute in respect of Niamh. What was before the Inquiry was a scanned copy retained by Niamh's mother when she handed the principal to the Social Work Department.

Sandy Cunningham expressed surprise that no analysis was done in relation to risk on any child though he accepted that he had never examined logs or any paperwork to satisfy himself that information was being accurately recorded and analysed. He suggested that was Liz Anne Davenport's responsibility. He confirmed that after 4<sup>th</sup> October 2009 and following a Care Commission inspection a document had been produced which bore to be a risk assessment document although the topic of risk of suicide was not covered. Professor Platt gave evidence that children in care are at elevated risk of suicide, from the very fact of being in care, and that elevated risk increases rises where there are additional factors. As has been noted above, he expressed surprise that despite the voluminous papers from the Open Unit relating to Niamh and Georgia, it was impossible to know if any judgement had been reached about their levels of risk, and if so what that judgement amounted to. Without individual risk assessments, it is impossible for there to be a care plan tailored appropriately to an individual child's needs and it also makes it impossible for any one responsible for the health, welfare and safety of a child to know what risks there actually are. Ploughing through collections of documents, many of which contain out-of-date information, needless repetition and on occasion wholly inaccurate information is not the proper or professional way of approaching such a crucial matter. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(14) Psychological Therapy</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It was clear from the evidence that both Niamh and Georgia had very serious behavioural difficulties. Niamh was grieving over the death of her boyfriend, and had what was described as 'anxious attachment' towards her father.

She was treated no differently by Tanya. It may be however that the fact that she, unlike her half-siblings, had not been officially adopted by Tanya caused her difficulties.

These resulted from a chance meeting between Dr. O'Connor and Niamh in the Open Unit. They were not part of any plan. At one of these sessions Niamh informed Dr. O'Connor when they were completing a form together that she had felt suicidal that summer. Unfortunately, Dr. O'Connor chose not to ask Niamh anything about that statement. He was unaware of the overdose of 27<sup>th</sup>/</span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB> and of the existence of the suicide note. Why that vital information had not been communicated to the in-house psychologist I cannot understand. Had there been proper communication among staff, and had a risk assessment existed, then Dr. O'Connor would have been provided with fuller information which one hopes would have prompted him to explore the significance of 'feeling suicidal that summer'. Niamh had agreed with Dr. O'Connor towards the end of September 2009 that she would participate in a programme to commence in late October. Dr. O'Connor thought that was a positive sign. Whether at the time Niamh agreed to commence the programme she anticipated being in a position to undertake it cannot be known.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Put broadly, there were various attempts made over the years, when the girls were in care and also at home, for CAMHS and assorted counselling services and psychological services to become involved.

As a matter of practice in </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span lang=EN-GB> then and now, in circumstances such as these there is an automatic referral to psychiatric services, and on </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> October 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Georgia</span><span lang=EN-GB> was visited at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Merlin</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB> by Ami Parsons, a member of the Mental Health Team based at Hull Royal Infirmary.

Given the limited number of beds available in the area, he did not think she could have been accommodated in a psychiatric ward that evening, and as CAMHS operated a 9 to 5 arrangement, that option was not open to him to explore. At the end of July 2009 Niamh presented at the Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley on two occasions, the first as a result of the overdose of valium she had take when in care at East King Street, and the second after she had self-harmed by cutting her wrist badly, on neither occasion was it suggested by the medical practitioners who attended to her that Niamh should be seen by either a psychiatrist or a psychologist for assessment. When young people such as Niamh attend Accident and Emergency departments of hospitals in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB> presenting with histories suggesting serious self-harm, or suggestive of a suicide attempt there must be value in having a psychiatric/psychological assessment carried out as near to the time of presentation as possible.

This state of affairs runs the risk that someone reading such a document may be misled as to the reality of the situation. The contents of these reports can often be an important factor on which decisions are taken in relation to the placing of people, whether young or old, mentally or physically handicapped, and it is essential that what is in any report is not only completely accurate, but also completely comprehensive. For example, in the latest Care Commission report on the Open Unit there was a reference to CCTV being in place throughout the campus. That statement was not an accurate one. There was no CCTV in place in the Open Unit, and the CCTV in place in the communal driveway was operated by the Secure Unit, and not continuously monitored. Further, the latest care commission report available to the Inquiry in respect of the Open Unit referred to measures being in place to deal with absconding. This was misleading in that it referred only to measures put in place after absconding had happened i.e. the Traffic Light System, and not to any measures or strategy to prevent it happening. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>(16) Transport </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> and The </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Erskine</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Bridge</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

One area of concern for him, shared by me, was why, given the case histories of both Niamh and Georgia, no judgement as to the risk of suicide was ever reached by those in the Open Unit and reference has already been made to that issue in this Note. In his conclusion he makes three preliminary recommendations which I repeat here for the benefit of those responsible for the welfare and safety of young persons in their care.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
