Written submissions were prepared and lodged, and on 25 March 2013 parties were given the opportunity to make additional oral submissions.

No dispute took place regarding the choice of route. The choice of route was that of the driver and was unremarkable and reasonable. The A73 southbound is the main arterial route linking Lanark and the M74 motorway. It is routinely used by commercial and private traffic, has a road surface of standard tarmacadam which is regularly inspected and maintained and is subject to a maximum speed of 60 mph.

From a point 90 metres north of the bridge the southbound lane of the A73 was dressed with a grip enhancing surface. This "shell grip" surface extends to cover the northbound lane prior to the bend leading to the bridge and continues on both lanes across to the south side of the bridge. The presence of the bridge is indicated by road signage and furniture. The lanes of travel are separated by hazard warning lines which warn drivers of an unspecified hazard ahead. Extending parallel to the north and south sides of the carriageway are solid white "edge" lines that define the extent of road available for use. Located periodically on the grass verges which bordered both sides of the carriageway are hazard warning posts which warn of a soft verge or steep embankment on the driver's offside verge. Drivers exiting the final moderate right hand bend are warned of the road narrowing on both sides and of a left hand bend with a minor junction on its outer circumference ahead, by 2 large warning signs sited on the south verge. While driving downhill towards the bridge on the straight, there are two large bold "SLOW's" painted on the eastbound lane. The "shell grip" surface commences immediately thereafter. Its purpose is to assist drivers in reducing the speed of their vehicle through braking on the approach to the hazard. Immediately after the second "SLOW" the roadway alters to a left hand bend incorporating a super elevated camber which assists drivers to negotiate the bend. The bend is initially slight but then tightens sharply to traverse the bridge. It is just prior to the bend tightening that the shell grip surface extends to cover both lanes of the A73. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

He did not start slowing down until he was immediately in front of the bend and applied the brakes and tried to turn." He heard the release of gas associated with braking in heavy vehicles. He heard a friction with the road which suggested they were sliding and he could see the impact of turning the steering wheel was having no effect.

He first encountered snow in that area at the start of his shift between 5.30 and 6.00 pm the previous evening and ploughed to take slush off the road, leaving it 'black' underneath. He then turned and gritted the area with rock salt at or about 6.30pm. He last treated the southbound carriageway of the A73 prior to the incident at about 3.30am but was treating the northbound carriageway when he came upon the accident scene. He kept an eye out for frost and ice but at no time saw any. He is very familiar with the locus and regards it as an area requiring extra caution, by reason of the tight, almost 90 degree bend at Castledyke Bridge and because it gets snow when other parts of his route do not. It is not however an area which becomes icy in his experience. He cannot recall ever finding ice there, although it is part of his job to check. He concentrated his efforts on the A73 stretch of his route that night because of the weather conditions, gritting it with the maximum amount of 40 grammes per square metre. The road was running black at 3.30 am. There was no ice. Temperatures were between 1 and 3 degrees. He regularly checks the gauge in his cab. At approximately 5.45 am he approached the A73 from the B7055 at Wiston Mains, 1.3 km south of the bridge, alighting at the bridge at about 6.15 am. The road at that time was slushy, with road markings still visible. The temperature was probably 1 degree C.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

There is little difference between ice and compacted snow/slush as agents for reducing traction. All can cause a loss of control. The one significant difference is that black ice can be difficult to spot and therefore can catch a motorist unaware. However, it was not difficult to spot the 2 cm or more of snow and slush which covered much of the road surface that morning. The slippery conditions were obvious as was the potential risk of black ice, whether or not there was black ice lurking underneath. Any driver obeying the Highway Code, and taking on board the obvious cues to restrict speed and sudden braking and manuovering, in line with the visible conditions, would also have been guarding against unseen ice in so doing.

His input was necessarily restricted therefore to statements made by him to police, together with the instructions he was able to give to his counsel. The weight to be given to his recorded police statement is limited. Albeit he had the benefit of legal advice and his solicitor was in attendance, no caution had been administered, he was not subject to questioning or clarification by his solicitor and, most importantly, he was not giving evidence as a witness to this Inquiry. There are clear inconsistencies between some aspects of the accounts given by him and the other evidence in this case. Some are more significant than others. There is no suggestion from anyone other than him that any discussion took place about changing the date of the excursion, or any concern about the proposed route to the M74. I have already dealt with his position on the issue of black ice. He also maintains in his statement that he applied his brakes coming down the straight, just before the shell grip commences, and lost control at that point. Both road traffic experts are clear that his recollection is faulty in this respect. Had control been lost at that point, some 90 metres from the bridge, the bus would not have travelled onwards to the bridge, but would have been forced by the camber onto the left-hand verge. Mr Munro's recollection is that he braked at this point because he became aware of an approaching HGV and was concerned that the bridge was too small to accommodate both vehicles. No-one else saw an approaching vehicle, including the Gritter driver, Mr Meikle, who was the first to arrive on the northbound carriageway. In fact, it seems clear that Mr Munro had commenced his turn across the bridge at the point of losing control and being unable to complete it. Mr Seward, his own accident analysis and reconstruction expert, is in no doubt, based on the location of the impact with the bridge, that the coach did indeed start to turn into the bend just prior to the loss of control. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Mr Munro also speaks to being in a higher gear than would be expected to deal comfortably with a tight turn and there is no evidence available to contradict this.

Others place a lower figure on such a fair-weather assessment. Exceeding such a theoretic maximum speed would cause the back wheel to rotate counter-clockwise and overtake the front wheels. It is therefore the speed beyond which the vehicle will go out of control. This was not tested, did not take into account variables such as tyres, the state of the road and the specific handling characteristics of the coach. No reconstruction took place. In any event, all are agreed that conditions were very far from normal on the morning in question. Mr Seward was unable to provide a maximum speed for vehicles negotiating the bridge in the prevailing conditions that day. He opined that the fact that Mr Munro had successfully started the turn before control was lost suggested that his speed was one at which the turn could have been safely negotiated had all remained equal. That of course ignores the fact that all did not remain equal. The bend itself became more acute and the coach would require to turn more dramatically to meet that. That part of the turn carried out did not involve full lock, otherwise why would Mr Munro still be able to turn the wheel "frantically" albeit to no effect? Mr Seward described the contact between coach and bridge as "definitely not a glancing blow" - it didn't almost make it. The turn had only just commenced, the road was covered in snow and slush, probably to differing depths and consistencies, making it impossible to say that all remained equal throughout. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

There is no evidence that he failed to comply with paragraphs 228 - 230 of the Highway Code. Within 20 minutes of setting out he was faced with increasingly hostile weather conditions together with the negotiation of a narrow bridge, via an almost 90 degree turn, with a large coach. The successful traversing of that bridge in these conditions would have tested any driver. However, the hazards were obvious. The road was snowy, slushy and could have been icy. There was drifting in places. The approaching bridge and the challenges it presented were not a surprise. I do not accept Mr Smith's submission that it was not until Mr Munro became aware of the loss of grip that his perception of risk changed. A professional driver should not have to wait until an obvious potential risk in fact materialises before he factors it into "his on-going dynamic of the road conditions as he perceives them".

The evidence points to loss of grip. Skidding on slippy roads is not inevitable and does not happen in a vacuum, however. It occurred at a time when Mr Munro applied his brakes in order to control his speed which by inference he judged to be too high for the manoeuvre he was undertaking. Mr Seward explained that the danger of braking stiffly is that in so doing you can lock the wheels and cause the vehicle to slide. The coach had been engaged in a slight downward trajectory for approximately 1 km prior to the bridge. His speed during that 1 km reduced from 36mph to 27mph before rising to 31.8mph approximately 300m from the bridge and falling to a last recorded speed of 25mph (minimum 23pmh) at the point of disruption of the chart. These speeds indicate that he did not attempt to adjust his speed sufficiently in anticipation of the approaching bridge by means of gradual, gentle braking which would have obviated the need for the application of the brakes immediately prior to or during taking the bend. It would have been a reasonable precaution, in the circumstances to refrain from applying his brakes as he went into a tight bend. It would have been a reasonable precaution, in the circumstances, to refrain from attempting to negotiate that bend at a minimum speed of 23mph. Even if Mr Seward is right that speed may not by itself have caused a loss of control on the bend, it is surely unwise for a driver to approach any hazard on the basis that he may manage to negotiate it successfully, particularly when he has the means of increasing the probability of so doing within his own control - drive more slowly. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Likewise, if loss of control arose out of the brakes locking due to hard braking, then the back wheels would attempt to overtake the front wheel, altering the point of impact. Had Mr Munro applied harsh braking at the start of the turn, the coach would not have started to turn as it did, it would have gone straight on. If already taking a curved path when harsh braking caused wheel lock, it would continue in that curved path. That is not to say, he explains, that the brakes could not have locked in the last split second before impact. Of course, from the point where Seward says the loss of control occurred to the collision would take less than a second at 23 mph, reducing yet more at 27 mph, so this scenario cannot be ruled out. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

In my view, for the purposes of this Inquiry, such an approach is unhelpful and unnecessary. The cause of the accident was the loss of grip between coach tyres and road resulting in a loss of control of steering. That loss of grip could have been avoided had the approach to the bridge been taken at a lower speed, gentle braking being applied during the 140 metre descent towards the locus to lower it significantly. However slippery the road may have become on the corner leading to the bridge, it was not so slippery as to prevent all of the other vehicles which followed the coach easily coming to a safe halt on that descent. Mr Munro did not brake at that earlier point. As a result, the speed at which the coach entered the bend was felt by all, including the driver, to be too fast to comfortably take the corner and Mr Munro responded to that calculation by braking on the bend. The road was potentially slippery by dint of its coverage. Whether that braking was harsh or gentle, it coincided with the loss of control and it would have been a reasonable precaution which may have prevented the accident and thereby Natasha's death, had the need to brake at that point been obviated. It would have been a reasonable precaution which may have prevented the accident and thereby Natasha's death, had the speed at which Mr Munro attempted to negotiate the corner been less than that at which it was in fact taken. He then would not have had to brake at that point. He then would have had options in relation to selecting an appropriate speed which he denied himself. He then would not have risked losing control of the back tyres by reason of excess speed, or braking, whether or not that in fact took place. Any skid which took place regardless of such precautions, by reason solely of the road surface, could have been ameliorated or mitigated had these precautions been taken. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

He did so prior to the coach leaving, and again reminded the pupils approximately 10 minutes into the journey, walking up the bus and specifically telling pupils to get their belt on. Some chose not to do so. It may be that the near presence of an adult might reinforce the verbal message. No evidence was led from any of the non-complying pupils which might cast light on whether it would have influenced their behaviour that morning. Of course it is in the interests of passengers that all use the seatbelts provided throughout any journey. That is the rationale behind the existing legislation. I note that South Lanarkshire Council have confirmed that they will give consideration to the placement of staff throughout a coach when arrangements for school trips are being risk-assessed. I do not doubt that all Local Authorities charged with responsibility in connection with school trips will wish to consider whether further measures such as that proposed are viable and should become part of the risk assessment process, but the evidence is not before me to allow me to determine that they should embark upon such a process. Likewise, witnesses were asked about the feasibility of introducing sensors to display the failure to secure seat belts in coaches. The only evidence in relation to the technicalities of such a system came from Sergeant Bell who indicated that the technology is available, that a dashboard display indicates the non-wearing of a belt by means of a visual signal or audible ping but that as far as he was aware no coaches currently utilise it. He had contacted a number of coachbuilders who indicated that the issue was the cost. There are ways for reluctant passengers to fool the system and the question arose of who would monitor any alarm. It would have to be the responsibility of someone other than the driver. Head teacher Mark Sherry thought that some form of sensor system, showing when belts not being worn, was worthy of further consideration, albeit the subject seemed to have been first broached with him during his evidence. Such systems, their attractions and potential difficulties were not the subject of further evidential scrutiny nor were the substitution of lap belts with three-point belts. In the absence of any detailed evidence directed to the exploration and resolution of the feasibility, viability and effectiveness of such measures, I simply do not have necessary evidential basis to permit the making of findings in respect of these issues. I narrate the terms of such discussion as did take place in order that it may spark further discussion and exploration. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
