As a result he was often unable to provide the inquiry with information on matters of detail or was forced to make assumptions or speculate and for that reason, but through no fault of his own, his evidence was not as helpful as it might have been. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

He went into the deceased's cell. The deceased was lying on his back on his bed with his clothes on and with his head at the end of the bed remote from the cell door. He looked as if  he was sleeping. Dougall shook the deceased's foot twice but got no response. He tested for the deceased's pulse on his wrist but found none. Dougall stated he had then run to the hall and spoken to Prison Officer Cullion, who was downstairs in the wing, telling him something was the matter with the deceased and that he should come and see him.

A couple of minutes later two nurses, Claire Louise Donlon and a nurse he knew only as "Jamie" arrived. The crash bag, which was stored in the satellite hub of the wing, was brought by another officer to the cell and he saw the nurses starting CPR. An ambulance was called and arrived about 15 to 20 minutes later. There was a delay of about 5 minutes in opening the doors at the back of the wing while keys were obtained for it from the gate house to allow the paramedics in.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

He saw the deceased slouched on the bed with the small of his back against the far wall. He was grey in colour, looked very unwell and did not appear alive.

Her colleague, whom he only knew as "Jamie", arrived and both started to tend to the accused. A minute of two later Officer David Duff came with the crash bag and the two nurses started CPR with mouth to mouth resuscitation and chest compression. They continued with this until the paramedics arrived which he thought was about 15 to 20 minutes later but felt a lot longer. He was not aware of any delay in their arrival.

All nurses were given basic training by Kalyx to enable them, whatever their discipline, to be able to respond to any situation at the prison requiring nursing care. She stated that nurses of whatever discipline when training to become nurses are taught basic blood pressure nursing skills and interpretation of results and only a cardiac nurse in a cardiac ward would be given greater training in detecting problems from blood pressure measurements.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

At some point during the evening, the precise time of which she could not remember while with her colleague Jamie McDonald, another Mental Health Nurse, she had received a radio message informing her of a code blue. The duty manager, Sharon Ainsley, who was also with her at that time informed her of the location of the call. She went to the deceased's cell which took her between 30 and 60 seconds. The cell door was open and she saw the deceased on his bed, partially upright, with his back pressed against the wall in a slouched position, both legs on the bed and his body at a forty five degree angle. She entered the cell.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

One of the prison officers moved the deceased so he was lying on the bed on his back. CPR was begun immediately and lasted five to ten minutes until the crash bag arrived. The crash bag contained <i>inter alia</i> an ambi bag, a defibrillator and a sats machine (for detecting oxygen saturation in the body). The two continued CPR using the ambi bag and chest compressions. Miss Donlon placed the pads of the defibrillator on to the deceased's chest , connected them to and switched on the defibrillator but at no point was the machine able to detect any heart rhythm. She also placed the sats equipment on the deceased's finger and this detected very low oxygen saturation at this point. CPR was continued by the nurses until the paramedics arrived. The paramedics were briefed by her and they removed the nurses' equipment and attached their own defibrillator. It was they who turned the deceased's body around so that his head was closer to the cell door for better access.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

She and a colleague, Paul Coyle, were mobilised at 18.56 and had driven directly to the Prison, activating their sirens and emergency lights. The arrived at 19.04.They were unable to gain immediate access to the Prison because they had to wait for the gates to be opened but were only delayed by a couple of minutes. On arriving at the deceased's cell she found two people performing CPR on him which she confirmed was being carried out correctly. She and her colleague attached pads to the deceased's chest and connected their own defibrillator to him. She stated that the defibrillator assessed the patient's heart rhythm and determined whether there is a shockable rhythm. She explained that a shockable rhythm is where the heart is in ventricular fibrillation ie is quivering, because there is abnormal electrical activity passing through it. The machine did not detect any electrical activity at all in the deceased's heart i.e. there was no heart beat, which contra- indicated an electrical shock being administered. She had felt the deceased's neck and found no palpable pulse. CPR was recommenced and she had a vague recollection that the deceased was turned around so his head was closest to the cell doors as shown in photograph one of label one. They endeavoured to intubate the deceased but were unable to do so. There was no sign of life. They injected him with epinephrine (adrenalin) and atropine via a venflon inserted into the deceased in an endeavour to stimulate his heart. This was not successful. CPR was recommenced.

On the evidence given by the paramedic, Ms Scott no criticism can in my view be made of the procedures adopted by the nurses to resuscitate him nor of the equipment available to them. Equally I am satisfied that the paramedics' attempts to revive him were satisfactory and that the delay to their entry at the gate to the prison was minimal and of no significance.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

200%'><span lang=EN-GB>It was suggested at one point to Miss Donlon that it might be helpful if a specific question was to be included in the nursing assessment form, of which the first page of production seven is an example, along the lines of "Do you have a cardiac problem?" That was something apparently which is included in the form a general practitioner completes when taking on a new NHS patient. However a prisoner would need to know that he had a heart problem and she conceded that other questions in the form, for example about taking medication, would alert a nurse to this anyway. In any event I observe that such a question <i>is</i> included in the form which the prison doctor completes and in the circumstances of this case failure to ask such a question in the nursing assessment is of no relevance.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
