She had been admitted to hospital due to pain  in her back which may have been associated with a previous fall. Initially she was looking well, talking to her family and not in too much pain. While in hospital she had a fall and, possibly, a second fall as a result of which she fractured her femur. The family had questions about this but there was limited evidence before the court about which comment could be made. She was moved to another ward and was not too happy about it. She did not want to be there and her mood varied.

Having heard all the evidence I looked at the purposes of a Fatal Accident Inquiry in terms of the Act and my initial reaction was to wonder what was intended to be achieved and then what actually has been achieved. This was a lady of 84 who was prone to falls. This much was noted and, indeed, she had more than one fall while in hospital. That suggests that risk assessment in general and falls risk assessment in particular could have been an issue. There was no evidence about it. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dougall</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> was described as disruptive and that was, apparently, the reason she was moved to a side room. She was recovering from a fractured femur and her mobility was limited. She needed assistance with all aspects of personal care. The question of observation of someone with such limited mobility and with such needs was something which might have been considered but again there was no evidence about this. Questions were put to witnesses about doors to side rooms being opened or closed and what any policy might have been. It is fair to say that there were different understandings of what might have been said to have been the "policy" but no expert or even managerial evidence about this. There was clear confusion in the eyes of some witnesses about who was in charge of the ward. The status of Staff Nurse Hammon (who was a grade higher than Staff Nurse MacAulay) when she was not working a core shift and was working a bank shift seemed to be the cause of confusion at least to some staff. While she herself was clear about her status on 11 July she was nevertheless undertaking tasks that were normally done by the charge nurse such as preparing rotas. Did the confusion have any effect on what was happening on the ward the day of the fall? What is the "official" position about staff working at a lower level when they are working on the bank and not on the core staff? What would be the view of an independent expert in nursing practice? Once again no evidence was led about these matters. There was conflicting evidence about the part played by qualified nurses in washing, dressing or toileting or otherwise taking part in the personal care of patients. That could have been relevant insofar as there was evidence that while </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dougall</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> was shouting from the side room (possibly that she needed to go to the toilet) the two senior qualified nurses on the ward were at the nursing station a matter of feet away. I raise these matters because there was some evidence about them but, in the end of the day, there was no evidence of any direct connection to </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:

The issues may, however, be of importance to Fife Health Board in their consideration of ongoing issues arising from the whole circumstances of the days from 11 to </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>15 July 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=4 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>So, bearing in mind the purposes of a Fatal Accident Inquiry, we appear to be left to deal with the unfortunate death of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dougall</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>, an elderly and somewhat frail lady with a pre-existing heart condition. According to some of the medical evidence her heart condition was such that she could have had a heart attack at any time. She had a fall four days before her death as a result of which she sustained a fractured humerus. Did that fall contribute to her fatal heart attack? Could the fall have been prevented? Was there any fault in any system which contributed to her death? In the absence of independent or expert evidence it is difficult to comment beyond these areas. Given all that one may wonder why the Crown decided to go to the trouble and expense of a Fatal Accident Inquiry. It became clear as the evidence came out that the reason for that was likely to have been the terms of the post mortem report produced by </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dr</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Risso</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:

I do not regard it as necessary or appropriate, standing the evidence heard and the purposes of a Fatal Accident Inquiry to make any recommendations with regard to further inquiry or discipline.

It comprises 4 bays containing 6 beds each and 6 side rooms each containing 1 bed.

During the day the complement of staff on the ward was 4 trained nurses and 4 auxiliaries (or Health Care Support Workers), on the back shift 3 trained and 3 auxiliaries and on the night shift 2 trained and 2 auxiliaries.

More than one witness described ward 5 as "a busy shift" and indeed one bank nurse said that there were many nurses on the bank who would not do work on ward 5 as it was so busy, demanding or stressful.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:

The untrained staff also came into bands and I understand auxiliaries to be band 2 and Health Care Support Workers to be band 3.

       150%'>MacAulay</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> who is also a band 5 nurse. There is no doubt whatsoever that this caused confusion in the minds of some staff.

Indeed from her own evidence she spent part of the day undertaking tasks that the charge nurse would normally do such as dealing with rotas on future shifts. While technically she may not have been in charge of the ward at the relevant time I am in no doubt that to all intents and purposes she was regarded as the charge nurse by some of the staff.

She had sustained a fall in March as a result of which she had fractured her femur. If she walked at all she needed the use of a zimmer.

I make the comments to assist Fife Health Board in looking at issues which have arisen in the course of evidence and which might merit some attention. The first relates to the nature of the tasks carried out by staff at different levels. On the one hand some of the auxiliary nurses thought that qualified staff would not carry out  such tasks as personal care, toileting etc. On the other hand qualified nurses suggested that everyone pitched in and did what was required. I do not think there is evidence of any culture of demarcation and the only possible relevance of this evidence in this Inquiry is where there is a suggestion that two nurses, Elaine Hammon and William MacAulay sat at the nurses' station while Mrs Dougall was calling out that she needed to go to the toilet in the minutes immediately before she was found on the floor. These nurses agreed that they were at the station but they were undertaking various tasks and, in any event, different people including </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mr</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:
       150%'>MacAulay</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> had been in the room. If, as was said by some witnesses, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:
      150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dougall</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> was calling for help to go to the toilet and she was calling out a lot, then regardless of whether or not </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mr</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:
       150%'>MacAulay</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> had been in the room, she felt she needed help. I find it slightly puzzling that two senior nurses should sit close to the source of these calls and, apparently, ignore them. One of them had been in the room and had done nothing to get help for the toilet if that is indeed what she wanted. The other said that when </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mr</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>MacAulay</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> came out of the room she heard the door close behind him. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dougall</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>'s calls for help were noticed but not acted upon.

The door is glazed for most of the top half and there is a curtain on a rail over that part of the door. To the side of the door is a window which also has a curtain on a rail along its full length. There was not complete agreement in the evidence as to when doors are open or closed or curtains drawn closed or open. However it appears that the general policy would be for the door to be open and the curtains drawn open. That enables staff to see the patient inside the room. The door might be closed if the patient had an infection.

The door may also be closed and the curtains pulled closed if the patient was being seen by a doctor or if there were personal care needs being attended to such as washing or dressing or using the toilet.

From the post mortem report she had previously had a heart attack. She was mentally alert and communicative. She knew her own mind but could be impatient. The hospital notes contain a number of references to her being noisy and disruptive. She would use her buzzer frequently, shout and bang a cup or glass to attract the attention of staff. She was described as demanding but seemed to be liked by most of the staff. Other patients complained about the noise she made particularly at night and some were even threatening to self-discharge.

The hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries would be the main risk factor in heart attacks. In this case the degree of narrowing could have led to a heart attack at any time. He was sceptical about the finding relating to the left anterior descending coronary artery. There may have been a thrombosis instead. A coronary dissection is uncommon and involves bleeding into the layers of the wall of the artery so the wall pushes into the lumen causing restricted flow of blood. Dissection usually occurs in younger people. Thrombosis occurs typically in the older age group and is when a fatty deposit in the wall of the artery ruptures. A blood clot forms in the lumen and this partially obstructs the flow of blood. Dissection and thrombosis do look similar and can only be seen properly under a microscope. The histology slides of the heart show sub-endocardial left ventricular fibrosis and fresh patchy infarction without an inflammatory infiltrate. The fresh infarction is sub-endocardial and not transmural. Fibrosis is scarring which indicates that Mrs Dougall had had a heart attack in the past even if she maybe did not know about it. It would have been months or years previously. The fresh patchy infarction shows a fresh heart attack. There is no inflammation which means it was very recent, typically 12 to 24 hours before. Therefore there was a heart attack 12 to 24 hours before she died. Sub-endocardial means the inner surface of the wall is damaged. That can arise where there is an imbalance between the muscle demand for bloodflow and actual bloodflow. So, if there was a thrombosis in the coronary artery which did not completely block or an arthrosclerosis then strain is put on the heart. It would have needed a fair increase in work rate of Mrs Dougall's heart to cause her death. Here we have something in the lumen and therefore a coronary infarction. Death was the result of a heart attack caused by a narrowed lumen.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=31 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>He was then asked about the contribution of the fall and fracture on 11 July to death on 15 July.
