It is the function of the FAI, where appropriate, to establish whether there were any reasonable precautions which might have prevented the death and to examine whether any defects in the system working were identified which contributed to the death. Thus the objective of such a public enquiry must be to ensure where lessons can be learned and steps taken to avoid any future recurrence, that these are identified and brought to the attention of those who are in a position to implement them.

There was a subsequent letter which seems to have been composed by Mrs Ewing but was sent in the name of Janette Owens, Depute Director of Nursing which is also part of Production 4. The family is quite clearly dissatisfied with the response it received and there are avenues which can be taken or which could have taken to pursue these complaints. However, unless there is some connection between the complaints and the handling of them on the one hand and the death of Mr Johnston on the other hand, the issue of complaints handling or procedure is not one for a Fatal Accident Inquiry.

The procedure is one which is relatively straight forward and is used as a means of feeding many different classes of patients who have difficulty obtaining nutrition. There was evidence, for example, of stroke patients being fed by this means. The use of Peg tube feeding was something to which the staff in Ward 5 was accustomed.

A full endoscopic examination is carried out and if all is well the stomach is distended with air. A finger indentation is made on the patient's abdomen and this is seen on the endoscope. The light on the endoscope is set to a high level of brightness and this is seen from the outside at the point of the indentation. The spot is marked on the skin which is then cleaned and a local anaesthetic is applied. A small needle is inserted and assuming there is no indication of any damage as a result a larger needle is pushed through and the endoscope indicates when it has reached the stomach. A wire is passed through and the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> tube attached with a fixing device.

Consideration was given to his general state of health and the procedure was described as "always potentially problematic". The procedure was carried out and the notes describe it as being done without complication. Mr Johnston did complain of abdominal pain for about two days but that was normal after such a procedure. The doctors would have been concerned if there had been pain on feeding. When he was discharged Dr Church said that he was struck by how well he looked. He had gained 6 kgs and there were no problems reported with the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> site.

Dr Church said that from his examination of the literature it was a major complication in 3 to 4% of cases and a minor complication in 7 to 20% of cases. Mr McKay said that perforation was relatively uncommon but was a known complication. The removal of Mr Johnston's gall bladder could have had some effect in respect that there may have been some adhesion between the colon and the stomach. It would not have been routine to scan for this. He felt that the sort of injury seen here was quite rare, occurring in fewer than 1% of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertion cases. Had it been discovered at the time, Mr McKay doubted that Mr Johnston would have survived anaesthetic and surgery to remedy it. The wall of the colon is paper thin and it was likely that those inserting the tube in 2007 were unaware that they were going through the colon. Mr McKay stressed that </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> tubes were inserted in people who were otherwise very ill.

It was important to bear in mind that while feeding supports nutrition it has no effect on the underlying disease process which is likely to cause further problems as the patient ages and/or the disease progresses. Doctors who were asked to speculate about Mr Johnston's life expectancy suggested that it would have been weeks or months at most even without any complications arising from the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> or line infection. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

If the tube is removed that track can close. The existence of the track allows for replacement of the tube. If, as in this case, the tube had been removed before a track could develop, there would be a hole left in the colon. This would allow faeces to leak into the peritoneal cavity and that could result in peritonitis and a surgical emergency. The belief was that if the perforation of the bowel had been discovered at the time of the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertion in 2007 that Mr Johnston may well not have survived the necessary remedial surgery. With the tube in place a fistula develops which is said to be a controlled situation and not life threatening. A fistula is described as an "abnormal communication between epithelial surfaces".

It too is a procedure which carries risk. While Mr McKay said that he felt nasojejunal feeding should, perhaps, have been considered, the method used was appropriate. Nasojejunal feeding may carry less risk of infection but with the injury to the colon there was an increased risk of discharge. There were also considerations in relation to the patient's comfort given the need for further endoscopy and access to the stomach.

In actual fact, having reviewed the evidence of the various medical witnesses, there is not much of a difference amongst them.

It is clear that there is a difference in the medical approach to what that profession terms "causality" and the legal approach to what lawyers call "causation" and there is also a difference of view amongst doctors about whether the application of the above logic may be stretching causality too far. That may well be the case but it is not appropriate to try to adjudicate on what must be objective views of doctors especially where there is a measure of agreement amongst them and the differences between them come down to emphasis. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

He found the perforations of the bowel and said they were partly healed and showed no sign of leakage into the abdominal cavity. There was an abnormal opening between the bowel and the stomach which was not properly healed to the extent he could place a 4mm probe through it. He thought this was the likely source where the infection originated. There was no other potential source apparent at autopsy. In cross-examination he said that he saw no evidence of infection at the site of the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line but he did not rule out the fact that the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line played some part in the infection. He did not see the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
 11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:150%'> line. If there was a working diagnosis of central line infection that was not in conflict with his findings. He disagreed that the source of an infection could have been a leakage through the skin as that had healed well and he did not see an external faecal fistula on examination. He remained of the view that the source was the opening in the bowel and stomach. When asked about causality he felt it was not stretching it too far to say that a known complication was the underlying condition for the sepsis. Therefore he did not disagree that line infection was the likely source of infection but suggested that it arose due to the underlying condition.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

While Dr Vennemann agreed that there was no leakage apparent, the perforation between the rear of the bowel and the stomach had not healed sufficiently and while adhesions could prevent leakage, the colon and stomach were sticking together and infection could have entered blood circulation from there. Dr Gibb felt that there was only a tenuous connection between the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
 11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:150%'> insertion and the cause of death but he did concede that if the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> had gone in properly in the first place there would have been no need for a </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line and therefore no line infection. Mr McKay was also asked to comment on the causes of death and confirmed that the absence of peritonitis made it unlikely that any faecal matter had leaked from the bowel into the stomach. It was more likely that any infection came from the fistula which may have been the result of the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line.

He agreed that the infection could have started at the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> site which was an open wound but he felt that while there was a chain of consequences from the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> to the infection which led to death there was no direct link one with the other. Normal practice would be to remove any infected line but Mr Johnston's co-morbidities would be a factor in deciding what to do. Mr McKay did not feel that it was likely that Mr Johnston would have survived further procedures. He confirmed that line infections were relatively common. He described how infections can arise in lines and the nature of most of those infections. He concluded that the fistula from the failed </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:
 150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> tube would be a plausible source of the infection and the probability that it was the actual source was more than 50%. That conclusion does not vary greatly from that of Dr Vennemann who had based his conclusion on what he saw on physical examination of the body at autopsy.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-27.0pt;line-height:150%;punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>(28) I have, therefore, reached the conclusion that there is no compelling evidence to say that Dr Vennemann was wrong in attributing a complication from a </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertion as a cause of death. I say that not simply because of the logical progression stated above but because the evidence all seems to concede that the likely source of infection was the bowel/stomach. As to causality or causation that is a matter of opinion. Differences in opinion in this area have not had any contribution to Mr Johnston's death. There remains the issue of whether the cause of death should be amended to show that the infection was a </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line infection. Once again there is no real disagreement that this is the case. Dr Vennemann saw no evidence of it but he did not have access to the line itself and said he could not comment if it was a contributory cause. He found no trace of infection at the insertion site but readily conceded that the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;
 line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:150%'> line could have played a role in Mr Johnston's death and the presence of the line was significant and could not be excluded in the whole chain of events. There seems no doubt that the primary cause of death was sepsis. That sepsis was most probably caused by infection of the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line. The infection of the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>TPN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line most probably emanated from the site of the misplaced </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> line. Therefore I have concluded that it is appropriate to adjust the second cause of death to reflect that.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-27.0pt;line-height:150%;punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>(29) There is no doubt that Mr Johnston had many medical problems some of which were serious and could have resulted in his death. The combination of what the doctors called his "co-morbidities" painted a picture of a very sick man. He had become prone to falls. He had reached the stage where he could not look after himself in his own home. It was clear from the evidence of his GP and from the notes from the practice that he had significant input on a regular basis from nurses and doctors in the community. He had been quite ill earlier in 2009 necessitating hospital admissions. Without wishing to appear to be unfeeling or unsympathetic to Mr Johnston's family, those doctors who were asked about his general condition did not rate his life expectancy to be high. Weeks and months were mentioned more than once. It has to be accepted that the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertion in 2007 went wrong. What went wrong was a known complication of the procedure. The procedure itself seems to have been carried out according to proper practice. It may be down to good fortune that nothing went wrong until the original line was removed. The evidence suggested that if the bowel perforation had been discovered in 2007 and surgery undertaken to remedy it, Mr Johnston may not have survived that surgery. Once it was discovered then the medical staff seems to have done everything they could and there was no professional criticism of what they did. Where other procedures were suggested it seems to have been a matter of personal preference rather than professional practice. Central line infection is relatively common. There was no evidence to suggest lack of hygiene or poor handling of the line. There was evidence from Dr Gibb that mortality from line infection was quite low but it tended to occur where there were a number of co-morbidities. Sadly, once Mr Johnston caught this infection his general health meant that his ability to fight it was diminished. As with any death it must have been distressing for the family to watch Mr Johnston deteriorate fairly quickly. By that time it seems clear that there was nothing that the doctors could do for him.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Which method is appropriate would be a matter of clinical judgement. There was no evidence that there were any guidelines and, in fact, there are probably none. The impression I got from Mr McKay in particular was that guidelines were not necessary. Given the evidence before the Inquiry it would not be appropriate to make any comment in this area. It was also suggested that there was no system for review of problems with </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertion. I was not certain if he meant in the community or hospital or both but, whichever, there were few questions in this area except to Dr Stuart who seemed quite satisfied with the opportunities either formal or informal for nurses to bring problems to his attention. In any event there was no expert evidence about either GP or District Nurse practice. He suggested that Catscan or ultra sound scan should be routine in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>PEG</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'> insertions. Those who were asked about this described it as impracticable and possibly even unnecessary. There was no expert evidence in this area.

It is apparent from the evidence of Mrs Sutherland along with that of Mrs Ewing and Mr Labonte together with entries in the notes and the summary of the meeting with Mrs Ewing and subsequent letter that the family was not happy about a number of aspects of Mr Johnston's treatment while in hospital. The family seems to have made a formal complaint which Mrs Ewing said was investigated and the result reported. The family remained dissatisfied but did nothing further to progress and advance their complaints. There was no evidence in this Inquiry about the complaints procedure or any defects in it. There was no suggestion or evidence that anything related to communication with the family or complaints played any part in Mr Johnston's death. The statutory purposes of a Fatal Accident Inquiry are clearly set out and I regard it as inappropriate to comment on areas outwith those purposes when there is no evidential link to the death especially where there is very little evidence about communication or complaints procedures.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Many of them sat through the evidence and they conducted themselves with great decorum listening to what must have been difficult and at times distressing evidence. I would, however, ask if this Inquiry was necessary given both the purposes of an Inquiry in terms of the Act and the whole medical picture including the expert evidence available to the Crown, presumably before any decision was taken to hold an Inquiry. I would also ask why it was thought either necessary or appropriate to lodge so many pages of productions most of which had no bearing on the Inquiry. I spent many hours reading through the productions and I have no doubt that Mr Clark and Ms Lake would spend even longer. The cost of reproduction alone must have been significant never mind the cost of time to the public purse be it the Crown, NHS or Legal Aid. Witnesses had to negotiate their way through the productions which were in 5 volumes. I am not sure if volumes 3 and 4 were referred to at all. If the Crown deems it necessary to hold an Inquiry only relevant documentary productions should be lodged. I accept the need to disclose but what is disclosed does not necessarily need to be lodged in court.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
