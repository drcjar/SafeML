He was employed by Maxwell Farms who had a contract to recover swedes from that field. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(7) Alexander William Riddoch was a highly experienced worker, energetic, conscientious and reliable, highly regarded by his employers and was generally regarded as second in command to the farm manager. On </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>22<sup>nd</sup> January 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>, there remained an estimated eight to ten trailer loads to be taken from the field to the home farm. The system employed was the same as had been used before, namely that one employee operated a machine known as the swede harvester to lift the swedes from the ground, elevate them onboard the harvester and discharge them into a trailer which was drawn by a tractor driven by another employee parallel to the track of the harvester. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(8) In order to keep the harvesting continuous, a fleet of tractors and trailers was used whereby each tractor driver took it in turns to fill his trailer from the harvester and thereafter return to the home farm, discharge his cargo, and then return to the field. While each tractor was away its place in a track parallel to the harvester would be taken by one of the other tractors. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(9) Four tractors were used for this purpose.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(10) Alexander William Riddoch, who had organised the whole operation, had completed one run and was awaiting his turn again at the field. He had stopped his tractor and trailer at the bottom of the field parallel to a stob and wire fence which separated that field from its neighbouring field until the time came for him to take up his place alongside the harvester. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(11) Overhead power lines supported by wooden poles ran across the fields at right angles to that fence. Pole No. 9 supporting the overhead power lines is situated at the fence.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>Alexander William Riddoch`s tractor had been driven past pole number 9 and came to a stop with the trailer approximately one third past the pole.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(12) The tractor operated by Alexander William Riddoch had an on-board computer which stored a record of the operations of the tractor. The trailer was a tipping trailer the tipping function of which was controlled by a hydraulic system controlled by a computer in the cab of the tractor. Analysis of the information in that computer disclosed that the trailer had been raised by the driver activating the lifting programme from inside the cab. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(13) During the process of tipping the trailer from a horizontal position to its near maximum elevation at 48 degrees it came into contact with one of the two high voltage overhead lines which traversed the field. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(14) When the trailer was tipped the highest edge missed the line closest to the tractor but caught on the line furthest from the tractor. As the trailer came into close proximity of that second cable which it touched it is probable that arcing would have occurred between the cable and the nearest point of the trailer to the cable. That arcing would be accompanied by a sparking and probably a loud noise. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(15) From his position in the cab with the engine running the driver would be unable to see the sparking or hear the noise. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(16) When that arcing and touching occurred there would be a voltage drop in the supply system. The cable touched would have been transmitting 6,350 kilovolts at the time. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(17) The distribution of electrical power is provided by numerous organisations across the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>United Kingdom</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>.

The actual line height at the point where contact occurred was 6.63 metres. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(20) In terms of Section 3(1) of said Regulations,</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>"Distributors ... shall ensure that their equipment is a) ....b) so constructed, installed, protected, used and maintained as to prevent danger, interference with or interruption of supply so far as is reasonably practicable.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>In terms of Section 3(2) ... distributors shall a) for each of their overhead lines assess the foreseeable risk of danger from interference, vandalism or unauthorised access having regard both to the nature of the equipment and use of the surrounding land and classify the degree of the risk. b) .....(c) ... shall take measures to safeguard the equipment commensurate with the nature and class of risk to which it gives rise.

All circuits are protected against damage caused by excess of current arising from faults or overloads. The line involved in this incident was part of a circuit known as the Warthill House Spur. That circuit was protected by a circuit breaker known as a Loanhead North PMR. The type of circuit breaker used was type GVR gas-filled vacuum recloser. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(22) The operation of the recloser was controlled by a device known as a Polarr Protection Relay which was linked by radio signals to a control room of the DNO situated in Inveralmond House, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:

The effect of the opening - a trip - is to cut off supply to the whole system downstream of that circuit breaker. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(25) At the material time the device was programmed to respond to the following changes</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(a) A current in excess of 160 amps (overload protection);</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(b) A current in excess of 20 amps flowing to earth (earth fault);</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(c) A current less than 20 amps but greater than </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:

Examples of transient conditions are lightning strikes, airborne objects such as debris of certain kinds, branches of trees, and bird activity which may cause bridging between a live line and a leak to earth.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(28) In order to avoid loss of supply throughout the circuit when one of these transient conditions applied, the Polarr device provides for an immediate or delayed opening of the circuit breaker but also for automatic closure. The automatic closure facility, however, is restricted to a limited number of operations. It ceases to be available if there are four "over-current" incidents within a set period of time or four earth faults or two sensitive earth faults. In that condition the circuit -breaker is said to be" locked out"</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(29) Once the automatic closure facility is unavailable the circuit is open and no power flows past the circuit - breaker. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>(30) All the information on the activity of this automatic system is relayed back to </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'>Perth</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:Arial'> by radio signals.

The effect of a reclosure from </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%;font-family:
