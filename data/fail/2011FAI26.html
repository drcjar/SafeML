The sheriff is to hear all the evidence and any subsequent submissions made on that evidence and then to make a determination setting out the circumstances of the death of Kenneth McLean under reference to the five considerations set out in Section 6 insofar as they have been established to the satisfaction of the sheriff. The sheriff's purpose and function within the confines of a Fatal Accident Inquiry are determined by Section 6.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

For example, I do not consider it a coincidence that the scaffolders, John&nbsp;Park and Robert Simpson, both gave evidence to the Inquiry that they were not responsible for the erection of the scaffold. John Park and Robert Simpson were employed as scaffolders by PBL Construction Limited. They travelled between sites erecting and altering scaffold as required. At the Inquiry, they were unable to name other scaffolders employed by PBL and had not seen other scaffolders employed by PBL. Ultimately, they had to accept that what they had told the Health and Safety Executive shortly after the accident was accurate, namely, that they had in fact been responsible for the erection and the alteration of the scaffold throughout. Overall, they wished to distance themselves from the responsibility for the state of the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

I do not propose to outline his evidence in that regard as it is dealt with elsewhere. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[28] Similarly, I do not propose to outline Mr McLean's evidence in relation to the importance of properly fitted "hop-ups". This is primarily for three reasons. Firstly, Brian McLean is not a scaffolder. Accordingly, his opinion in relation to the erection and maintenance of scaffold is an opinion personal to him on the basis of his experience at other sites. Secondly, the necessity to have properly erected scaffold is self-evident and not disputed. Finally, those aspects of the erection of scaffold which may have been found wanting, are dealt with by me elsewhere. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[29] The main contractor at the site in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crathie Drive</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was PBL Construction Limited (PBL). </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[30] At the time of the accident the PBL Site Foreman was John Kearns. Brian and Kenneth&nbsp;McLean and Stephen Mackay had a meeting with the PBL Site Foreman John Kearns and Graham&nbsp;Nisbet, the Travelling Foreman of Talepine Limited. This meeting took place on or about </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>29 September 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[31] At that meeting Brian McLean, Kenneth McLean and Stephen Mackay were authorised to use the on site hoist to take the render, once mixed, to height. The Site&nbsp;Foreman, John Kearns, had explained that the use of the hoist would be shared by other trades such as bricklayers and joiners. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[32] When asked whether it was John Kearns or Graham Nesbit who told Mr McLean to work in that way, the response of Brian McLean was "both of them really because it is just normal." Both Mr Kearns and Mr Nesbit were aware that wheelbarrows would be used to transport the render. Mr McLean explained that whilst he might work using buckets of render, the transport of large volumes of render was best achieved using wheelbarrows. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[33] Scaffold is erected from the ground. The height of the scaffold is in large measure dictated by the height of the building, the top level being at gutter height for safety reasons. The top level of scaffold abutting the building in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crathie Drive</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was six levels high. The height of the fifth level was reduced compared to the height of the levels below. This was to fit in with the requirement that the top level corresponds to the gutter height of the building roof. Put shortly, the fifth level had reduced headroom. In addition, landing gates, which were present on other levels, were not present on the fifth&nbsp;level. They could not be accommodated because of the reduced headroom.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[34] Despite the absence of landing gates on the fifth level, the understanding by Mr&nbsp;Brian McLean (of the instructions given to him by John Kearns and Graham Nesbit) was to the effect that materials could be off loaded using the hoist at any level, including the fifth level. More particularly, Mr McLean was never instructed not to take access to the hoist at the fifth level.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[35] In the event that scaffold required to be altered, Brian McLean explained that he had been told to approach the Site Foreman, John Kearns. John Kearns was not permanently on this site. Accordingly, in the absence of John Kearns, Mr McLean would speak to a ganger on site, a Robert&nbsp;Binnie.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[36] Before commencing work Brian McLean did not have an induction meeting with John&nbsp;Kearns. Mr McLean was given a toolbox talk by his Travelling Foreman, Graham&nbsp;Nesbit. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[37] In Mr McLean's experience an induction meeting should have covered all aspects of safety on the site. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[38] Mr McLean was not made aware of any site rules, work methods or risk assessments.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[39] During his time on site, Mr McLean had a range of concerns in relation to the scaffold including what he considered to be the incorrect use of hop-ups to the side of scaffold which faced the external walls of the building. Mr McLean explained that certain trades required hop-ups to be located at differing distances from the external walls. Bricklayers require the hop-ups to be very close to the wall. On the other hand, roughcasters need a gap between the scaffold hop-up and the wall so that render can be applied. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[40] When hop-ups needed to be altered, Mr McLean would speak to John Kearns. As far as Mr&nbsp;McLean recollected, however, it could take three or four days for scaffolders to attend for the purposes of altering the scaffold. Mr McLean recalled scaffolders asking him why he had not moved the hop-ups himself, as the bricklayers had done. Mr McLean had refused partly because he did not require to relocate double hop-ups. He required single hop-ups which would allow space between the scaffold and the building sufficient for him to apply the render. In addition, Mr McLean understood that bricklayers required access to double hop-ups, one level at a time. This contrasted with the requirements of roughcasters who require a space between a single hop-up and the building on two or three levels at a time. This is because render can be applied to large areas of the building.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[41] The significance of this evidence, however, is that trades, other than scaffolders, were being allowed to alter the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[42] Mr McLean described in some detail concerns which he had in relation to the construction of scaffold at the apex area. He had advised both John Kearns and Graham Nesbit that the structure was unsafe. Eventually, Mr McLean just used the structure, shaky though it was. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[43] The significance of this passage of evidence was that it exemplified a casual approach by both John Kearns and Graham Nesbit to site safety. Although not a qualified scaffolder, Mr McLean had sufficient experience to express his concern at the safety of the scaffold at the apex area at the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
  "Times New Roman"'>Crathie Drive</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'> site. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[44] In relation to the hoist, this was operated by Stephen Mackay. He was not given instruction as to how to use the hoist but had used similar equipment elsewhere. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[45] After mixing the material at ground level, the labourer, Stephen Mackay, would put the render into one or two wheelbarrows and place these on to the hoist where the material would be raised to the required height.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[46] Mr McLean thought that, at the fifth level, there was a handrail fitted in place of landing gates. He could remember only one handrail. He could not recollect a toe board in place. A toe board at the fifth level hoist area would have prevented wheelbarrows being taken off the hoist at that level. A toe board can be removed comparatively easily. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[47] On this site, hop-ups were used to the outer edge of the scaffold as a means of gaining access from the scaffold to the hoist. Brian McLean, Kenneth McLean and Stephen Mackay had not been on site prior to the morning of the accident (on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thursday 13&nbsp;October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>) since </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Friday 7 October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. In the intervening period scaffold, including at the fifth level, had been altered to provide for the installation of a feature window. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[48] After the accident Brian McLean produced a manuscript statement summarising events from 29 September to the day of the accident.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[49] The manuscript statement narrates a number of concerns which Brian McLean had in relation to debris on the scaffold, the quality of the erection of the scaffold, the lack of scaffolders to remedy defects or alter the scaffold. Within the manuscript note there is also reference to Brian&nbsp;McLean being left a joiner's wooden stool with three short battens, on which Brian McLean was to take access to the highest point on the site. He then notes tellingly "shaky does not come into it" referring to this means of access to the apex area. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[50] On page 8 of the manuscript statement Brian McLean makes reference to fixing one or two&nbsp;missing double hop-ups and battens "for our own safety".</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[51] On </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>13&nbsp;October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Brian&nbsp;McLean recollected arriving on site between </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>8.00 am</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>8.15&nbsp;am</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. He was met by John&nbsp;Kearns. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[52] The application of the render would be from the top of the building downwards. The work was to commence at the rear of the building. It was intended to use wheelbarrows to transport the render from the hoist, round the scaffold at the appropriate level, to the rear of the building. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[53] The first job to be attended to was the mixing of the materials. This was done by Stephen&nbsp;Mackay at ground level. Brian McLean had work to do preparing the area for the render. Kenneth McLean intended to join Brian McLean to the rear elevation once the material was mixed. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[54] Kenneth McLean met the hoist platform transporting the wheelbarrows to the fifth&nbsp;level. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[55] Brian McLean took access to the fifth level by taking the internal stairwell of the building to the fourth level and thereafter walking on the scaffold to a ladder which he climbed to the fifth level. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[56] Kenneth McLean came up to the fifth level after Brian&nbsp;McLean. Kenneth McLean had removed one wheelbarrow from the hoist. He had also removed tools from the hoist which he deposited on the scaffold. Brian McLean offered to remove the second wheelbarrow from the hoist but Kenneth&nbsp;McLean asked him to take the first wheelbarrow round to the area to be rendered and he (Kenneth McLean) would remove the second wheelbarrow from the hoist. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[57] Brian McLean recalled a comment by Kenneth McLean to the effect that the scaffold was still "a fucking joke".</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[58] Brian McLean returned to the rear elevation of the building with the first wheelbarrow.

Brian McLean went down the scaffold immediately.

The document is silent about how materials are to be transported to height. Within the document there is a general assessment of risk prepared by David Poole of Quickseal. There is no reference to level 5 within the assessment. Mr&nbsp;Kearns said that although he had received the Quickseal Method Statement he did not discuss health and safety issues with Mr Nesbit and Mr Nesbit had not discussed PBL's&nbsp;Health and Safety Plan with him. The documents were exchanged but that was the extent of it.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[93] As far as Mr Kearns was concerned, there was no pre-start meeting with Mr&nbsp;Nesbit as such. There had been a meeting prior to Quickseal commencing work but this was not an official meeting. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[94] In relation to the day on which the Quickseal employees attended to commence work, Mr&nbsp;Kearns was vague. He believed that Mr Graham Nesbit had also attended. When the question was asked "Did you have a discussion with Graham Nesbit about how the material was going to be taken to height?" the response was "I probably would have, yes".</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[95] During his evidence the words "probably would have" were not uncommon. I questioned Mr Kearns as to whether he was making assumptions or could not remember. He could not remember if there was a plan in place in relation to taking the materials to the fifth level nor whether he had told Mr Nesbit that the fifth level was inaccessible (for the purposes of taking the goods from the hoist). </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[96]  In relation to the scaffold at the gable end, Mr Kearns instructed the scaffolders to attend to those alterations. In relation to the change from two-board hop-ups to one-board hop-ups, Mr&nbsp;Kearns had instructed Mr Robert Binnie, a General Labourer, to attend to that. Mr Binnie is not a qualified scaffolder. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[97] No training was provided to Quickseal employees in the operation of the hoist. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[98] Mr Kearns obtained a copy of the Wickham UDM Hoist Operating Instructions because when Mr Kearns took over responsibility for the site, there were no operating instructions on site. That said, Mr Kearns, did not recollect whether a copy of the Operating Instructions were given to Quickseal or to the employees of Quickseal. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[99] Initially Mr Kearns thought that he had given the employees of Quickseal an induction before they started work but admitted that he could be wrong. He was referred to the Site Induction Register to confirm that the persons named on the form had received induction on the Site Safety Rules. The names of Kenneth McLean, Brian&nbsp;McLean and Stephen Mackay do not appear on the register. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[100] Mr Kearns accepted that it was possible that the fifth level was being used as an access to the hoist platform.

On the days before the accident, a window had been installed which necessitated alteration to the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[103] After the scaffold had been altered and the window installed, Mr Kearns had inspected the window and the scaffold from inside the window. He had not gone on to the scaffold on the fifth&nbsp;floor. He conceded it was possible that, when looking out of the window to the fifth level bay of the scaffold, it would be possible that a missing rail had gone unnoticed by him.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[104] Mr Kearns was taken in evidence to a number of the photographs lodged as productions which showed that, as at 13 October, there were a number of defects in the construction of the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[105] On the day of the accident, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>13 October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, Mr Kearns was occupied by other business on site. He was aware that Quickseal employees were working that day. Mr&nbsp;Kearns was in the building under construction talking to labourers when he heard a bang. He noticed Mr&nbsp;McLean lying in the protected area of the hoist (an area at the bottom of the hoist fenced off to prevent persons walking underneath the hoist when it is in operation). A batten was lying partly against the mast of the hoist and between the legs of Kenneth McLean. Mr Kearns removed the batten and placed it in a skip nearby. Mr&nbsp;Kearns and a third party tried to assist Mr McLean until an ambulance arrived. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[106] Mr Kearns was referred to a seventeen page manuscript note of the condition of the scaffold as at </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>19&nbsp;October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.

Mr Kearns had no safety concerns regarding the use of hop-ups to the exterior of the scaffold. He described it as the "only system" that he knew because of the setting-out distance needed for the hoist at the base of the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Witness (4) - John Park</span></i></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[108] John Park is 45 years old.

In particular, he was never told not to unload at the fifth level. Mr Arthur required to offload at the fifth level because, as a bricklayer, he worked from the ground up using the scaffold as a platform to lay bricks and the hoist as a method to obtain bricks and materials. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[204] Mr Arthur was clear that there could not have been a mid-rail in place at the fifth&nbsp;level.

He would open the gate and put a piece of plywood to bridge the gap between the hoist and the scaffold. He would then pull out the wheelbarrow. The top rail caused a difficulty at the fifth level because you had to "hang over it" to get into the hoist. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[207] When asked on how many occasions Mr Arthur took the wheelbarrow from the hoist at the fifth level in this manner, he replied that it would be up to twenty times a day for approximately four days at that level. Mr Arthur not only assumed that Mr Kearns had seen this process taking place but also recollected Mr Kearns attending the scaffold to check on the progress of Mr Arthur's work. Accordingly, Mr Kearns would have seen this method.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[208] The work at the fifth level finished at the end of September 2005.

Part of his evidence involved an outline of the sources of evidence causing him to come to the conclusions which he reached in his Report. For the purposes of this exercise, it is sufficient for me to say that Mr Shelton spoke to the terms of the Report marked "Prosecution&nbsp;Report" dated </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>12 October 2006</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. It is a substantial Report divided into parts. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[264] Those parts of the Report which were referred to during the Inquiry paint a picture of the scaffold, the erection of which was dangerously substandard in places. Mr Shelton highlighted the fact that Mr Kenneth McLean, and others, were not inducted at the site. Neither of the scaffolders had been trained sufficiently to be familiar with the specific requirements for the safe erection of Kwikstage Scaffold. John Kearns, the Site Manager, was not familiar with the Kwikstage User Guide and Mr&nbsp;Shelton highlighted, for example, that the scaffolders were not aware of the requirements for tying patterns (the frequency and positioning of rigid fixings between the scaffold and the building). Similarly, Mr Kearns had made no formal checks of the tying ratio for the scaffold. Mr Shelton's Report also deals with the hoist. As the contract progressed, some sub-contractors, who had not received formal instruction routinely operated the hoist. No formal procedures were in place by PBL to inspect the hoist.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[265] These and the other examples cited by Mr Shelton summarise the poor standard by which this site was operated and supervised. The Report is damming in its terms.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[266] For the purposes of this Inquiry, however, Mr Shelton highlights in particular that platform brackets should not be used as an extension to the exterior of the scaffold. Had John Park and Robert Simpson been given appropriate training in the erection of Kwikstage Scaffold (or had they consulted the Kwikstage User Guide), such information would have been known to them. Similarly, if the Site&nbsp;Managers had been properly instructed so as to carry out effective weekly checks, they would not have permitted the use of platform brackets to the exterior of the scaffold. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[267] Mr Shelton highlights the manufacturer's guidance that tie bars are essential for two and three board platform brackets. A failure to fit tie bars could be fatal. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[268] Mr Shelton writes at pages 32/33 of his Report:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:45.0pt;margin-bottom:

There would be no warning of this."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The looseness of the brackets and their ability to spread or splay outwards thus leading to poor support of the board would be a major contributory factor to the reason for the board displacing. If a tie bar had been fitted and had displaced along with the board then it is likely that the tie bar would have landed in the hoist bay along with the deceased and the steel scaffold board. It can also be concluded that if the tie bar had been in position then the outer most board would not have moved off the platform brackets in the first instance."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[273] After the accident the upper guardrail between the scaffold and the platform on the fifth&nbsp;level remained in place. The implication is that, in order to remove the wheelbarrows of render from the hoist, Mr McLean removed (a) the mid-rail so that he could lean under or over the upper guardrail to take hold of the handles of the wheelbarrow, and (b) the toe board from the platform (so that the wheelbarrow could be removed without obstacle). </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[274] I do not agree with this conclusion. The conclusion appears to be based on the proposition that "The scaffolders and site manager believe that the guardrails and toe boards were in place along the front elevation and John Kearns went to the area to check on the fitment of the window and recollects no problems with the guardrails at this part of the platform." </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[275] It is evident that the recollections, even at the time, of the scaffolders and Mr Kearns were selective. The problems at the fifth level and elsewhere on the scaffold at </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>40 Crathie Drive</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> were so numerous that reliance simply cannot be placed on the scaffolders or Mr Kearns as a source of evidence that the guardrail and toe board were in place at the hoist area on the fifth level. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[276] The day before the accident the attention of Mr Kearns was directed to checking the fitment of the window feature, not the scaffold. Furthermore, he checked the fitment of the window from inside the building. He did not go on to the scaffold for the purpose of checking the window. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[278] Similarly, both in relation to the Mr Kearns and the scaffolders, there is no reason to believe that, had they inspected the scaffold, they paid greater attention to this area than any other area on level five. Had they inspected level five at all, they would have seen that toe boards and guardrails were missing elsewhere on that level.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[279] The dangers on level five would have been obvious over a substantial period of time. Yet those dangers were not rectified. That being so, it seems to me that no reliance can be placed on the information given to Mr Shelton by Mr Kearns and the scaffolders that before the accident a lower guardrail and toe board had been in place at the platform area in level five on the day of the accident. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[280] At the Inquiry, Mr Kearns was of the opinion that no one was allowed to offload goods from the hoist at the level five platform. The evidence which I heard indicated that such a practice had been ongoing since at least September 2005 with the tacit approval of Mr Kearns. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[281] Similarly, conflicting evidence was heard in relation to the alteration of the scaffold. Mr&nbsp;Kearns initially suggested that only scaffolders should alter the scaffold. It became apparent that certain alterations by certain trades were tolerated. However, even the extent to which scaffold could be altered by those trades was ill defined. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[282] I suspect that a blind eye was turned to such scaffold alterations partly because of the time it would take to have scaffolders (themselves unqualified in Kwikstage scaffold) return to make the alterations. Accordingly, pragmatism dictated that sub-contractors altered the scaffold as they saw fit. Such practice must have been known to Mr Kearns. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[283] I now return to the specific conclusion of Mr Shelton that the mid rail and toe board were likely to have been in situ prior to the roughcasters attending the site on the morning of the accident. The only evidence for this is the close proximity of a guardrail and a toe board lying on the fifth level near the scene of the accident. However, to suggest that these were removed by Mr McLean that morning is speculation. It relies on information imparted from the roughcasters and Mr Kearns. That information is in my opinion neither credible nor reliable. It conflicts with the evidence of Mr Brian McLean and Mr Stephen MacKay. More probably the guardrail and toe board would have been removed some days or weeks earlier on the basis of the evidence of Mr Kevin Arthur. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[284] There is ample evidence to suggest that the fifth level was being used routinely as an access point for the removal of goods from the hoist. The installation of a guardrail and toe board would have prevented or impeded the removal of goods from the hoist. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[285] If, on the morning of the accident, Kenneth McLean removed a toe board and one guard rail, it seems illogical not to have removed both guard rails. The removal of both guard rails would have considerably eased the process of removing the wheelbarrows from the hoist. The evidence that one of the guard rails remained in place after the accident supports in my view the proposition that Mr McLean found the fifth level hoist access area to have had the toe board and one guard rail already removed. He was not to know that in addition to these items having been removed, a tie bar which would have held the steel boards or battens in place, was also missing. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[286] It was suggested that the tie bar may have been knocked out of position (whether by the hoist or otherwise) and had fallen along with Mr McLean. A tie bar was found at ground level. I refer the evidence of Mr Shelton in this regard. Put shortly, he was of the view that it would be unusual for a tie bar to come loose in such circumstances. Moreover, if a tie bar had fallen with Mr McLean, Mr Shelton thought that the tie bar would have been found in close proximity to Mr McLean, his hard hat and the batten, namely, in the hoist cage area at ground level. Instead, a tie bar was found at ground level some distance from Mr Kenneth McLean, leading Mr Shelton to the opinion that no tie bar was in place at the fifth level at the time of the accident. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[287] Turning back to the missing guard rail, I note from the evidence of Kevin Arthur that he recollected leaning over a guard rail to remove a wheelbarrow from the hoist on to the scaffold at the fifth level. Mr Arthur described this procedure occurring twenty times a day over a four day period at the end of September 2005. If that is correct, it would imply that the evidence of Stephen McKay in relation to the condition of the scaffold on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>13 October 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> is to be preferred over that of Mr&nbsp;Kearns and the scaffolders.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[288] On 10, 11 and 12 October 2005, the only persons working at the fifth level would have been (1) the scaffolders on site on 10 October to alter the scaffold for the window to be installed and (2) the window installers. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[289] The scaffolders should have left the fifth level safe. It was clearly not left in that condition despite them saying that if they had noticed any problems, those problems would have been remedied. There were toe boards and guard rails missing on other levels as well as level five, despite the evidence of the scaffolders that such problems would have been made safe. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[290] The Scaffold Inspection Records show a lack of understanding of what was required by an inspection and what should have been noted.

150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[298] It would appear that Mr Kearns inherited a poorly run site. He may have instructed some improvements to working practices and to the scaffold but these were, in the scale of things, comparatively minor. His time was split between this and other sites. When Mr Kearns was off site, he delegated responsibility for site management to Robert Binnie, a labourer. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

If proper consideration and instruction had been given so that work could be undertaken by tradesmen at the fifth level, the accident might have been avoided. This is because arrangements would have been made to facilitate the transfer of materials to the fifth level (whether by extending the scaffold platform, replacing the hoist or otherwise). </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[300] If sub-contractors, such as Kenneth McLean, had been given an induction meeting before commencing work, he would have received definitive instructions (a) that he should not use the fifth level (b) that he should not offload materials at the fifth level and (c) he should not alter scaffold. It is not disputed that an induction meeting was not given to Mr McLean by PBL. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

On this occasion, a tie bar was missing. The first wheelbarrow was removed in a manner which did not displace the steel batten. When manoeuvring to remove the second wheelbarrow, Mr Kenneth McLean placed his weight on the outer most steel batten which splayed causing both it and Mr McLean to fall. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Scaffolders employed by PBL Construction Limited were not experienced in the correct erection of Kwikstage&nbsp;scaffold. Accordingly, whilst they may have been experienced scaffolders, the impression remains that they were experienced in the incorrect erection of Kwikstage scaffold. The site managers were not qualified to check the experience of the scaffolders nor whether they were erecting the scaffold correctly. That said, commonsense and a basic familiarity with the erection of scaffold, should have alerted the site&nbsp;managers to the absence of essential safety measures such as missing toe boards, guardrails and the like.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
