Unfortunately, he had a weakness for drugs and on the evening of 21 August through to early hours of 22 August 2010, Mr Irvine consumed a lethal combination of drugs. Others suspected that the drugs consumed by Mr&nbsp;Irvine had been adulterated. I do not know whether Mr Irvine realised this but carried on regardless or whether he was unaware that the drugs may have been adulterated. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Mr Irvine was described variously as the life and soul of a party and having lived a life at a hundred miles per hour. I have no doubt that he will be missed by his friends and family. I send my condolences to them for their loss. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
