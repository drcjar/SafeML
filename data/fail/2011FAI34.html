She was 51 years old at the time of her death.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(2) In about 1996, Mrs Norma Haq, developed symptoms suggestive of gallstones, as a result of which her GP, Dr Madhok, arranged an ultrasound scan, which confirmed the diagnosis.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(3) She was thereafter placed on the waiting list for laparascopic cholycystectomy in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(4) While on the waiting list, she and her husband visited </span><span lang=EN-GB>Pakistan</span><span lang=EN-GB>, where she underwent an open cholycystectomy procedure in a hospital in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Pakistan</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(5) In late 1997, Mrs Haq again developed epigastric pain and was referred to Dr&nbsp;Richard Park, Consultant Enterogastrologist at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bon</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Secours</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(6) After carrying out various non-invasive investigations, Dr Park referred Mrs Haq to Mr Douglas Hansell, Consultant Surgeon, to arrange an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(7) Dr Park had performed an ultrasound scan which showed that she had a dilated common bile duct, in addition to liver tests which indicated a slightly elevated bilirubin.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(8) ERCP is a procedure which allows the biliary tree and pancreatic ducts to be visualised using a combination of an endoscopic examination and radiological imaging. The procedure involves the passage of a side viewing endoscope via the patient's oesophagus and stomach to the junction of the second/third part of the duodenum. The endoscope is then pulled back and manipulated, allowing the ampulla of vater to be visualised on the medial wall of the duodenum. The ampulla is then cannulated with a fine bore plastic tube and radio-opaque dye is injected into the biliary tree (cholangiogram) and/or the pancreatic duct system (pancreatogram). X-ray films are taken of the dye within the duct systems. Further procedures can then be undertaken, such as balloon dilatation of the ducts, removal of gallstones from the common bile duct, or sphincterotomy, where a division of the muscle fibres of the sphincter of Oddi situated at the lower end of the common bile duct is performed.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(9) Mrs Haq was seen by Mr Douglas Hansell, Consultant Surgeon, at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>19 February 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, who arranged for her to be admitted for an ERCP procedure.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(10)  An ERCP and sphincterotomy was carried out at Ross Hall by Mr Hansell on </span><span lang=EN-GB>25&nbsp;February 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mrs Haq being discharged home the following day.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(11) Mrs Haq was seen by Mr Hansell on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3 March 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> at review and a further appointment made for </span><span lang=EN-GB>23 April 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(12) Mrs Haq returned earlier, on </span><span lang=EN-GB>12 March 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, complaining of slight epigastric discomfort, having been commenced on cimetidine, a drug to alleviate ulcers, by her GP, Dr Madhok. Mr Hansell requested her to continue with said medication until her review on </span><span lang=EN-GB>23 April 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(13) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>23 April 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, when Mrs Haq was seen at the out-patient clinic at Ross Hall by Mr Hansell, the epigastric pain had settled, and accordingly, Mr Hansell recommended to Dr Madhok, that if the pain returned, Mrs Haq might benefit from a further course of cimetidine. No further appointment to Mr Hansell was made at that time.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(14) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>18 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mrs Haq was again seen by Mr Hansell in the out-patient clinic at Ross Hall, complaining of epigastric pain during and after eating. Her liver function tests were normal.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(15) Arrangements were made for her admission to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>25 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> for an upper GI endoscopy and ERCP.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(16) </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> was an appropriate hospital for a patient to undergo an ERCP, performed by a competent general surgeon.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(17) The ERCP was to be of an exploratory nature, to inspect the site of the previous sphincterotomy.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(18) At about </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.45 am</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mrs Haq was taken from her room to a well staffed X-ray department in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, where the upper GI and ERCP were to be performed.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(19) The procedure commenced, after sedation, with an attempted ERCP. It is unusual to do ERCP before the upper GI endoscopy, although some endoscopists may choose to do so.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(20) During the course of the attempted ERCP, a perforation of the duodenum occurred retroperitoneally, that being recorded in the medical notes by Mr Hansell as &quot;a mature duodenal perforation was noted. For contrast meal later&quot;. He immediately withdrew the scope and made no attempt to cannulate the ampulla or inject dye. He did not inspect the ampulla of vater.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(21) A perforation of the duodenum, particularly retroperitoneally, is known to be a very serious condition requiring surgery as soon as possible, in order to prevent the spread of enzymes and fluids from the pancreatic duct spreading into the retroperitoneum and intra&#8209;abdominally.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(22) At that time it was thought to be at the first and second parts of the duodenum, which is a &quot;C&quot; shaped organ.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(23) An instrumental perforation may occur even although the endoscope has passed with ease and has been gently advanced and carefully manipulated by the endoscopist.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(24) At </span><span lang=EN-GB>12 noon</span><span lang=EN-GB>, it was noted by Dr G J Paterson, Consultant Radiologist, that &quot;decubitus X-ray films of the abdomen confirm the presence of free intraperitoneal air&quot;. Films taken on the table after ERCP showed that there was considerable retroperitoneal gas. Three abdominal X-rays taken during screening at 10.23 and </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.39 am</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> demonstrate extensive retroperitoneal gas with insufflation around both kidneys and the retroperitoneal extending along the psoas muscle. An erect chest X-ray of </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, demonstrates elevation of both hemidiaphragms with extensive gas present beneath both diaphragms.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(25) At </span><span lang=EN-GB>1.00 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> when Mrs Haq was returned to her room she was complaining of severe abdominal pain, for which she was given 7.5 mg of morphine intramuscularly. She required the administration of a further 3 mg of morphine intravenously by the resident medical officer within an hour.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(26) A blood sample report timed at 3.15 pm on 26 August 1998 showed an elevated white cell count of 15.8 (normal range 4-11) and an elevated serum amylase of 315 IU/L. (27) The elevation in the white cell count indicated an inflammatory response to some form of injury. The elevation in the serum amylase is normally indicative of inflammation of the pancreas. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct may cause a rise in amylase level.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(28) There was availability in theatre at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It was also possible to re-schedule other operations to accommodate an emergency.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(29) There was a note, timed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.00 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> by Mr Hansell &quot;for laparotomy this evening&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(30) </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> is the largest private hospital in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>, with facilities for cardiac surgery and has a fully equipped Intensive Care Unit. Intensive Care facilities can be provided within 15 minutes maximum to patients. It is licensed by the Greater Glasgow Health Board for the use of 101 beds. Had Mr&nbsp;Hansell wished to transfer Mrs Haq to a National Health Service specialist unit, that would have been arranged without difficulty.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(31) There was a note, timed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.45 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>, by Dr Colin Miller, Consultant Anaesthetist, &quot;nasal gastric tube to be passed pre-operatively&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(32) At </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> anaesthetic commenced for laparotomy. The laparotomy was performed by Mr Hansell, assisted by Mr E Dickson.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(33) At laparotomy, a perforation, situated at the second and third part of the duodenum situated retroperitoneally, was repaired in two layers, and a gastrojejunostomy was performed. Mr Hansell did not biopsy a sample at the perforation.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(34) The second and third part of the duodenum is the classic site of perforation by an instrument in the course of ERCP. It is very rare for an ulcer to develop there.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(35) An instrumental perforation had occurred during ERCP earlier that day.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(36) About </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.50 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, post&#8209;operatively.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(37) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>27 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq was transferred to the High Dependency Unit from the Intensive Care Unit.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(38) Thereafter until </span><span lang=EN-GB>2 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, she had daily blood tests carried out, comprising a full blood count, urea and electrolytes. There were four occasions when she had liver function tests and blood amylase levels carried out. Her prothrombin time, which is an indicator of clotting ability, was carried out on eight occasions over the period.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(39) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>2 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq's white blood cell count was 18.8. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(40) The nursing notes for that day were &quot;good morning. Shower taken with minimal assistance. More independent. Mobility increased. Vital signs stable&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(41) Mr Hansell wrote on that day to Dr Madhok, GP, to give an update on Mrs Haq's progress (production No 5 for the Crown). That letter states:-</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;Dear Mr Madhok, </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>I thought I would write to give you an update of Mrs Haq's progress. You will remember that we planned to perform an upper GI endoscopy and ERCP at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26&nbsp;August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The findings of that investigation were most interesting, in that she had an old perforation of the second part of the duodenum. In view of this I took her to theatre later that evening and found a perforation in the duodenum at the junction of the second and third parts. There was no obvious pathology here and I simply repaired the perforation and performed a gastrojejunostomy to facilitate gastric drainage.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Her progress to date has been satisfactory and I will write to you again once she has been discharged.&quot;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(42) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>3 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq's white blood count was 24.8, as a result of which Mr Hansell ordered an ultrasound scan of her abdomen to be carried out.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(43) Mrs Haq was suffering from sepsis which became severe about </span><span lang=EN-GB>22 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(44) Mrs Haq's condition required constant monitoring by way of a variety of scans, particularly CT scans, blood tests, cultures, biochemistry and all other available tests.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(45) Mrs Haq's condition required urgent aggressive surgery.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(46) The report of the ultrasound of Mrs Haq's abdomen, which was carried out on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4&nbsp;September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, stated <i>inter alia</i> &quot;some abnormal loops of bowel are noted in the right flank/RIF, lying just below the level of insertion of the drainage tube. Although no discrete collection is present, bowel at this site appears fixed, and an early localised infection at this site cannot be excluded&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(47) The white blood cell count remained elevated over the following days, peaking at 28.4 on </span><span lang=EN-GB>7 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Further it was noted that there was pyrexia at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> that day.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(48) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>8 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mr Hansell noted in records that a CT scan of Mrs Haq's abdomen showed the presence of fluid.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(49) Mr Hansell changed Mrs Haq's antibiotics, noting that if she was no better in the morning she would need a further laparotomy.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(50) On </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> anaesthetic for the laparotomy commenced at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and ended at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Dr Colin Miller being the anaesthetist.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(51) On that date Mr Hansell, assisted by Mr Dickson, performed a laparotomy, a right hemicolectomy and drainage of a retroperitoneal abscess on Mrs Haq.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(52) At </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.45 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq was transferred post-operatively to the Intensive Care Unit at Ross Hall.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>(53) Mr Hansell wrote to Guardian Insurance about Mrs Haq on that date (family production 2/5):-</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;This lady is currently an in patient in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>26<sup>th</sup> August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, this lady required an emergency laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer. Her post operative progress was initially uneventful but over the past few days her condition has deteriorated.

If, thereafter, severe sepsis developed mortality rate was about 50%, even in specialist centres. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>All the experts felt that other non-invasive tests, such as ultrasound scan or </span><span lang=EN-GB>MRI</span><span lang=EN-GB>, if such a scan was then available at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, should have been carried out first. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> found it difficult to support the need for an ERCP initially, while not ruling it out totally at a later stage. Mr Hamer-Hodges thought there were no indications at all for proceeding to ERCP at that time. Questions were asked as to how it was going to assist in diagnosis.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Charnley, stated that the correct order of investigation in any medical investigation is to do the safer and more minor investigation first, followed by those more dangerous and invasive investigations later. He said that ERCP was not a minor endoscopic procedure, but in fact a dangerous endoscopic procedure with an 8% complication rate with about 1% life threatening complications.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Techniques have advanced since 1998 and much more use is made of endoscopic ultrasound and MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) which would not generally have been available in 1998. These investigations are generally replacing ERCP now. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>All of the experts felt quite strongly that none of them would have proceeded to ERCP at that stage. Further, their views were reinforced by the fact that Mr Hansell himself considered the problem to be acid related rather than a biliary problem. However, Mr Hansell wanted to be sure that the earlier sphincterotomy which he had performed in February 1998 had not stenosed and was causing the same pain as had been present prior to that procedure. Liver function tests on this occasion, were normal. Ultrasound scan, may or may not have been conclusive. He wished to inspect the sphincter.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Although Professor Garden was prepared to accept that, at ERCP, Mr Hansell may have thought there was a perforated duodenal ulcer, it would be clear, at laparotomy, that was not the case, and that an instrumental perforation had taken place. It was the classic place for such a perforation occurring where the endoscopist had placed the endoscope just past the ampulla, ready to pull back the endoscope slightly to cannulate the ampulla. Perforation could occur even when it was thought that the scope had passed apparently uneventfully. The hole was described as being about 1 cm in diameter, which was consistent with an instrumental perforation. It was said it did not bleed much. Mr Hansell said that it was a pretty clean punched out opening with slightly thickened tissue around it, a fibrosed type tissue. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> disagreed with Mr Hansell's conclusions from his description of the wound, in that he said it was quite possible for the hole to be round if there was an instrumental perforation. Mr&nbsp;Hansell accepted that he had caused an iatrogenic injury, but maintained that there had been a pre-existing weakness due to an earlier ulcer or perforation. In evidence, he maintained his belief that there had been a perforated duodenal ulcer. At p 887, however, Mr Hansell did accept that the commonest cause of perforation at that site was traumatic perforation.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The overwhelming opinion of the experts, having considered the hospital notes and Mr Hansell's evidence regarding the description of the perforation was that it was an instrumental perforation and that there was no pre-existing weakness. The sighting of adventitia indicated a fresh perforation by instrument. In addition, Mr&nbsp;Hansell had not biopsied any tissue from the site, which certainly would have been appropriate if an ulcer or malignancy had apparently been seen or suspected in such an unusual site. Mr Hansell stated in evidence that there was no lumpy or frondy tissue to suggest a tumour, and therefore no biopsy was performed.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Looking to all the evidence I accepted the evidence of all the experts that this was an instrumental perforation.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was said by Mr Charnley that, while specialists in specialist units would not have proceeded to ERCP at that time, surgeons who were general gastroenterologists might have had a lower threshold to do an ERCP than a specialist. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> generally agreed with that. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> agreed that it was likely that both procedures, ERCP and upper GI, would be required to establish the cause of the symptoms. An issue was raised in the course of the Inquiry, that, if an ERCP was justified, whether both procedures, ERCP and upper GI endoscopy, should be carried out together in the order in which they were carried out. All the experts indicated that upper GI was the obvious choice to commence as it was less invasive. Further, it was thought that Mrs Haq's symptoms might be acid related and accordingly an upper GI may have revealed the problem. It was thought by the experts to be somewhat unusual to have both investigations together. However </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> stated that he was aware that others had occasionally undertaken these procedures, where they were indicated and it would be a matter of clinical judgement for the endoscopist. Mr&nbsp;Charnley who personally did two sessions of ERCP a week, accepted that some might do the ERCP before upper GI, but it was not something he had come across before. Mr&nbsp;Hamer-Hodges had not undertaken ERCPs. Mr Hansell maintained that his preference was for ERCP first when the sedative had best effect.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Given the evidence, that issue appeared to be one of clinical practice and not one in which a determination is appropriately made in this Fatal Accident Inquiry.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mrs Haq signed the consent form for ERCP. There was nothing written in the notes to indicate what had been said Mr Hansell, which is hardly surprising. It would appear from Mr Charnley, that the medical profession has generally tightened up procedures in obtaining consent to surgical procedures over the past few years. I do not feel it is appropriate to make comment on this matter, which should be left to the consideration of the medical profession, and is obviously in hand.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In the course of the ERCP, a perforation of Mrs Haq's duodenum occurred. Mr&nbsp;Hansell accepted that the perforation was related to the ERCP which he was performing and that the perforation was not a spontaneous perforation of an ulcer. He described seeing adventitia through the scope. He immediately withdrew the scope and made no attempt to cannulate the ampulla or inject dye. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> said there was no description of the type of endoscope in the notes. In evidence it was stated to be a side viewing endoscope.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell, in evidence, felt that the expert reports, and that of the pathologist Dr&nbsp;McFarlane, were based on a wrong assumption that he had attempted to cannulate the ampulla, when in fact that was not the case. There was no note at the ERCP procedure as to whether there had been an attempt at cannulation. When that was clarified with each of the experts, evidence was given, taking that into account.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>At the time of the ERCP, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that Mr Hansell might reasonably have believed that there was an ulcer in the duodenum, while Mr Charnley felt that assertion was somewhat bold and that Mr Hansell might have had a more open mind. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Films at the time of ERCP and immediately thereafter disclosed both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal gas.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell told Mrs Haq that the passage of the endoscope opened up the ulcer and told others present that this was the mechanism. In the afternoon, he told Dr Miller that he found himself looking through the ulcer. Mr Dickson, who was asked to assist Mr Hansell at the operation recollected that Mr Hansell accepted his intervention resulted in perforation, although he did not think Mr Hansell had passed a scope through a normal duodenum. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell felt he had been proceeding gently, and thought that a retroperitoneal perforation with an instrument was difficult to achieve. He had never read of any significant series explaining how to manage that (p 1175).</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In any event there was a laparotomy which commenced at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> that evening, performed by Mr Hansell with Mr Dickson assisting. Mr Dickson was Mr Hansell's trainee at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stobhill</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Dickson gave similar evidence to Mr Hansell regarding the appearances of the area to be repaired, he too believing that it was an ulcer. At that time he had very few years experience in surgery and might not have been in a strong position to give a firm opinion. Mr&nbsp;Hansell described him in evidence as a fairly junior house officer. When he gave his evidence in October 2001, he was 29 years old, and was an experienced SHO in General Surgery at Victoria Infirmary, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Since then, he has not seen an instrumental perforation of the duodenum, although he had seen on of the bowel. He had not seen a perforated ulcer in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> parts of the duodenum, but had seen such perforations in the first part. According to Dr Dickson, Mr&nbsp;Hansell, in explaining the proposed operation to him, had been very surprised to find a perforation in the duodenum while doing an ERCP.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The opinion of the experts given in various ways, was to the effect that a surgeon of Mr Hansell's experience, must have known that this was an iatrogenic perforation and not an ulcer, at laparotomy. It was untenable to maintain the stance that there was a duodenal ulcer. It was quite an exceptional site for the spontaneous perforation of an ulcer. There was clear, strong and compelling evidence from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mr&nbsp;Charnley and Mr&nbsp;Hamer-Hodges on this point. None of them took issue with the manner of repair, the only comment being that it was quite a substantial repair, consistent with an instrumental perforation. Mr Hansell's evidence was that the perforation was on the posterior and lateral wall of the duodenum, more or less opposite the ampulla.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>There were various comments from the experts as to why Mr Hansell had maintained his opinion of &quot;perforated? DU at second/third part of duodenum&quot; at this stage and subsequently to the patient, family and other medical persons dealing with her. It appeared that he had closed his mind to the possibility of instrumental perforation without an underlying weakness in the duodenum. Mr Charnley queried the possibility of Mr&nbsp;Hansell being unable to accept that he had caused the instrumental perforation, albeit it was a recognised risk of the procedure. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that if Mr Hansell genuinely believed that there was an ulcer, even at operation, he was &quot;misguided&quot;. Mr&nbsp;Hamer-Hodges raised the possibility of personal pride or vanity of the surgeon in not wishing to admit a mistake. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Charnley raised the very interesting matter that there was a blurred area as to whether a person such as a surgeon, was maliciously withholding information or whether there was a mental block in being able to accept it. Having heard all the evidence and assessed the witnesses including Mr Hansell, I came to the conclusion that Mr Hansell had not acted maliciously in withholding information, but had convinced himself as to the correctness of his diagnosis and his belief that he was dealing with an ulcer. He wrote on hospital notes and stated his diagnosis to others, who accepted what he said, possibly because none were in a position to challenge him on his diagnosis or his plan, and perhaps due to the respect in which he was held. This may have fortified his erroneous belief. It certainly underlines the importance of the specialist unit, whereby several consultants, experts in their own fields, can constantly discuss critically with each other a patient's condition, progress and plan of action. Had a specialist unit been contacted, it would have been unlikely that Mr Hansell would have maintained his erroneous belief in an ulcer without challenge. Nevertheless, even although not motivated by malice, information about Mrs Haq's true situation was therefore withheld from the patient and her family, and it is understandable as to why they feel that information was concealed from them and use the word &quot;cover up&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Although it was clear, by </span><span lang=EN-GB>noon</span><span lang=EN-GB>, that there was free intraperitoneal gas and therefore a laparotomy would be required as soon as possible, that decision was not taken until </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.00&nbsp;pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was said that Mr Hansell had an NHS commitment in the afternoon at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stobhill</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>. However he said that he could have rescheduled that if necessary. He did speak to Mr Haq about 2.00 to 2.30 pm that afternoon, when Mr Haq said that Mr Hansell had explained &quot;there was some old ulcer somewhere in the stomach which he couldn't see&quot;. He would have to open her and see. Mr Hansell stated that he told Mr and Mrs Haq that he believed he had found a mature perforation that had presumably perforated and sealed at some point prior to his procedure and that the passage of the scope had opened up the ulcer, either by the mechanical passage of the scope or the air being passed through the scope, and that consequently there had to be an operation to repair the perforation.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell gave evidence that he had found Mr Haq's pronunciation of English rather difficult, with which I would agreed. Mr Haq said that his wife was much better in the spoken English, while he was better at grammar and writing. I did think that Mr&nbsp;Hansell had given them information about Mrs Haq as matters progressed, albeit it referred to &quot;an old ulcer&quot;, but I am not entirely sure as to how much was absorbed by Mr&nbsp;Haq, due to second language difficulties, and to the stress and ultimate grief he sustained.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mrs Haq had complained of severe pain for which she was given a substantial amount of morphine. At </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.15 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, her white cell count was noted at 15.8 and there was an elevated serum amylase of 315 IU/L. That, according to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB>, should have indicated a surgical emergency.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>There was evidence that there was availability in the operating theatre at </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> that afternoon at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> and further operations could have been rescheduled if necessary for an emergency. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell thought that a perforation retroperitoneally could be dealt with conservatively if the leakage was contained. He had had experience of two perforations, one being an instrumental perforation by a colleague and one involving himself when his scope passed through a paper thin duodenal ulcer not expected to be there.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The evidence from the experts was all to the effect that a laparotomy should be performed as soon as possible, to prevent the spread of dangerous pancreatic juices outwith the duodenum. They are particularly powerful leading to contamination and destruction of tissue and infection in the upper abdomen and also in the patient being more likely to suffer shock and septicaemia. It was not a time for conservative management.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Professor Garden gave evidence to the effect that a surgeon who had not experienced that complication before might have considered it appropriate to wait and see what is happening to the patient, whereas, to a specialist experienced in that area, the development of intraperitoneal gas would mandate early surgical intervention and there would be little necessity for undertaking further radiology such as a contrast study.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Unfortunately the operation did not commence until </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30 pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It was said that in a similar situation in the NHS, great pressure would be put on the hospital administration to get space in theatre as soon as possible, but a theatre might not have been made available any earlier than the time when the operation in fact took place at Ross Hall. Delay lessened the chances of survival.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>At submissions on evidence, it was conceded by Mr Hansell's counsel that, having heard the evidence of the expert witnesses for the Crown, and having the benefit of hindsight, he ought to have taken the decision to repair the perforation earlier in the day on 26&nbsp;August 1998, and that had he done so, events might have taken a different course.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Charnley's evidence was that he would expect a mortality rate following perforation to be about 5 to 10% and the earlier the laparotomy was carried out the better. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought mortality rate from perforation occurring would be about 15 to 20%. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Once the perforation occurred, the management of the patient was critical. Surgery would be required as soon as possible. Constant close monitoring was thereafter required. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>According to the experts for the Crown, Mr Hansell was experienced enough to carry out the laparotomy and repair on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Mr Hansell's operation notes do not make reference to mobilising the colon (in order to clean that area out). Mr Charnley would have expected that to have been done, but commented that it would not be the first time that it had not been done by a surgeon. It was critical that the first laparotomy was done very well. He considered it a specialist procedure. He said that a surgeon really only gets one chance to operate on such patients and it is essential that everything is done properly, as chances of survival diminish once a patient gets into a cycle of operations and repeated infections.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was not entirely clear in evidence whether the colon had been mobilised and that area cleaned out. At one point Mr Hansell said that he looked in detail at the area of spillage and was happy that he did not need to pursue under the colon (p 1548). At another point (p 1549) he stated that the area was cleaned and aspirated as thoroughly as possible. He did not fully mobilise the colon lest he would have allowed the spread of infection, which otherwise might not have taken place. At p1563 he explained that partial mobilisation of the colon had taken place, but he did not actively cut tissue. At p 1623 he said that he did mobilise the right colon, explaining that he did not write that he had mobilised the colon in his operation notes, as it was obvious, since he had to do it to gain access to the duodenum which had to be mobilised extensively. Partial mobilisation of the colon was needed in any event, as a huge number of adhesions (from the operation in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Pakistan</span><span lang=EN-GB>) had to be divided to gain access.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>There was criticism of the lack of very close monitoring of Mrs Haq in the days following the laparotomy of </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. While there were many tests and results available, the experts thought that there should have been more available daily in particular, full blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests and coagulation. Mr Charnley stated that Mrs Haq required surgical review several times each day. The hospital complied with all requests made by Mr Hansell, but Crown experts and Mr Hamer-Hodges thought the management of the patient by Mr Hansell, who basically was on his own, fell short of the monitoring which would have occurred had Mrs Haq been in a specialist NHS unit. In essence, Mr Hansell had been alone responsible for Mrs Haq's care, with assistance from Dr Miller, intensive care. He was also able to speak to bacteriologists but, he was on his own. The whole ethos of the private hospital system appears to be care under a named consultant. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> felt that he (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB>) would not have been able to manage a difficult and complicated case such as Mrs Haq's on his own, without the benefit of contribution from his other specialist colleagues. In a specialist unit there was multi-disciplinary management with regular meetings regarding patients. There would be 15 to 20 patients a year in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB>'s specialist unit with similar problems.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Charnley described a honeymoon period of about 7 days post-operatively when a patient is apparently improving. Mr Hansell dictated a letter to Dr Madhok on 2&nbsp;September, and accepted he could have stopped the letter, given the changing situation. However on </span><span lang=EN-GB>3 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, the seventh day after the operation, a number of problems declared themselves, recorded in the nursing notes and biochemistry results, which should have mandated a CT scan which may have identified areas of potential infection. In fact an ultrasound scan was carried out on </span><span lang=EN-GB>4 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> which showed a probable abscess. Ultrasound is poor at showing abscess formation in the retroperitoneal and underestimates the degree of infection. Antibiotics were changed but </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that would be insufficient as they could not penetrate the tissues and clear away infected material. The infection had to be drained away. It was essential to identify all possible sources of infection. </span><span lang=EN-GB>A CT</span><span lang=EN-GB> scan would probably have shown the source of infection. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The situation of the perforation, whereby there could be extensive retroperitoneal contamination, would indicate a risk of retroperitoneal necrosis or infection. Mr Charnley thought CT scans should have been carried out from </span><span lang=EN-GB>2 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and would have been carried out earlier in his own practice. He said that type of perforation is notorious for causing widespread complications. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that the need for a CT scan was demonstrated from </span><span lang=EN-GB>3 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, after the results of </span><span lang=EN-GB>3 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been obtained. However a CT scan was not taken until </span><span lang=EN-GB>8 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought that the clinical signs and information available indicated a patient with severe sepsis, and whose condition was deteriorating. He said steps should have been taken to identify whether or not there were other organisms in the blood, to check the blood cultures and to examine the patient for a chest infection. Intravenous feeding would have to be checked for potential to introduce infection and culture of fluid from the abdominal drains would be required as would a culture of the urine. It may have been necessary to have an exploratory laparotomy if the source could not be identified by 5&nbsp;or </span><span lang=EN-GB>6 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In submissions in evidence, it was stated by Mr Hansell's counsel that Mr Hansell, now appreciated that a CT scan should have taken place earlier than 8 September 1998 and might have indicated a laparotomy should have been performed before 9 September 1998, thereby improving Mrs Haq's prospects of recovery.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>According to the experts, the effect of delay in the performance of a second laparotomy until </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> did not assist Mrs Haq's prospects of survival. Mr&nbsp;Charnley thought it was more serious than the delay of hours up to the first laparotomy. If there was a collection of infected material, it was only a matter of time before it would develop or have other consequences, such as necrosis, severe sepsis resulting in septic shock and multi-organ failure.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Transfer to a specialist centre, according to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB>, should have been made as soon as 3 or </span><span lang=EN-GB>4 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>, when there was evidence of sepsis following the initial repair for perforation. Mr Charnley was surprised that consideration was not given to transferring her to a specialist unit, with which sentiment Mr Hamer-Hodges agreed. At the very least according to the experts, she should have been in Intensive Care Unit and not a room or a ward. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell performed the second laparotomy, which involved a right hemicolectomy and the placing of a peritoneal lavage system. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> did not challenge that this was the appropriate procedure and Mr Charnley commented that he did not know if a surgeon at a specialist centre would have done a better operation. However, Mr Hansell had never before carried out that operation himself in totality, but had previously performed the constituent parts. It is done on a regular basis in a specialist unit. Mr Hansell felt that with 24 years experience as a surgeon he was well capable of looking after the problems she had.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Dickson stated he saw no evidence of peri pancreatic necrosis. He had not dealt with any cases of retroperitoneal sepsis, but he was well aware of the seriousness of such a situation, which could be fatal.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The experts agreed that after the second laparotomy, even in a specialist centre the mortality rate would be 50%. Professor Garden thought, looking to the notes and results which had been obtained, that from about 21 September 1998, it would have been very difficult to &quot;have turned back the patient's outcome&quot;, with which Mr Charnley agreed. Her best prospects of survival would have been at a specialist centre according to Mr&nbsp;Hamer&#8209;Hodges also, who gave evidence that there would be no guarantees as to successful outcome at a specialist centre, as there was a significant mortality rate, but she would have a much better likelihood of survival. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Immediately after the second laparotomy on </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq appeared to have a reasonable response. However, there were various indicators thereafter, such as the presence of a temperature, an elevated pulse rate, and intermittent pyrexia. Cultures showed that organisms had been grown from blood, all indicating a severe sepsis which is difficult to control. Rigors were noted at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.50&nbsp;pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> on </span><span lang=EN-GB>23 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. On </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mrs Haq was confused. There were biochemical abnormalities, which led </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> to the view that there were indications of impending renal failure and obviously multi-organ failure and multi-organ dysfunction.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr Miller, who had been told by Mr Hansell that the original cause of the perforation was related to an ulcer, went on holiday for a week, on </span><span lang=EN-GB>19 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Effectively, Mr Hansell was in sole charge of the care of Mrs Haq. Although not seen on a daily basis by Mr Hansell, there would only be a very few days when he did not visit her. Dr Miller's input had been as an Intensive Care Consultant. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>From 22/23 September 1998 there was no imaging in an attempt to exclude ongoing intra-abdominal infection. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> thought CT scans were necessary from one week after </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>. He summed the situation up &quot;Looking at Mrs Haq's progress over the last 4 or 5 days of her life, there was not doubt she was slipping from systemic inflammatory response into severe sepsis. I would have concerns about a surgical trainee who was unable to recognise or interpret these signs as evidence of severe sepsis syndrome and multi-organ failure.&quot;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He said that insufficient was done to establish the cause of the septicaemia. This may be a matter of clinical practice which is appropriate for consideration by the General Medical Council rather than a Fatal Accident Inquiry. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In the hospital notes and various forms relating to biochemistry, blood etc, there was written a variety of headings &quot;Peripancreatic necrosis&quot; &quot;Pancreatitis&quot; &quot;Perf DU&quot; &quot;Sepsis&quot; &quot;Intro Abdo Sepsis&quot; &quot;Hemi colectomy Ileostomy Septic&quot;. There was evidence from Mr&nbsp;Hansell disputing that Mrs Haq ever had peripancreatic necrosis or pancreatitis. He said he did not write those descriptions and presumed they came from other staff and, once on the system, had been repeated. Mr Hansell, in evidence, did not accept some parts of the experts' reports to which had proceeded on the basis of pancreatitis and peripancreatic necrosis. He disputed Mr Hamer-Hodges' assumption of pancreatic injury. That was clarified in evidence. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Charnley said that Mrs Haq did not have pancreatitis but had retroperitoneal (peripancreatic) fat necrosis of the right side of the abdomen which has similar appearances to pancreatic necrosis. Irrespective of the original cause, the conditions were very similar involving the same type of treatment.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>One of the reasons given by Mr Hansell for not referring Mrs Haq to a specialist centre was that he believed the specialist centres dealt with acute necrotising pancreatitis and she did not have a condition with which they dealt. At the time, he felt that the problem was intra abdominal sepsis and any general surgeon, working in the abdomen, would, in most cases, be comfortable to look after that condition. Within </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stobhill</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Mr Hansell would be a surgeon to whom biliary/pancreatic problems were referred. Since considering the evidence of the experts, he had revised his views.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>While Mrs Haq was becoming increasingly unwell, there was nothing to indicate to the hospital authorities or staff that Mr Hansell was failing to manage her care. He gave every appearance that he had a good understanding of the appropriate treatment for Mrs&nbsp;Haq. He made decisions regarding her care and his descriptions did not indicate he was unsure how to proceed. The decisions were not patently or obviously incorrect to nursing staff nor was his behaviour such that, at the time and on the information available to nursing staff, to approach management about Mrs Haq.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In giving evidence in court, Mr Hansell was courteous and confident, giving the impression of an experienced surgeon well in command of the situation. He was asked to give much detailed evidence regarding anatomy, which took some considerable time in court. He undertakes lecturing and teaches the techniques of ERCP.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Shortly before Mrs Haq's death, no time was lost in obtaining an intensive care consultant, during the night at short notice at Ross Hall. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The main thrust of the expert opinion, in respect of cause of death, suggested that even if finally pulmonary embolism was involved, it was certainly not the main pathology. Professor Garden considered the various blood results, particularly prothrombin times, and pointed out that as at 26 August 1998 her time was 25 seconds (normally 14-18 seconds), when fresh frozen plasma was given. After stabilising, she was put on anti thromboembolic treatment which was administered daily according to the drug kardex. He thought, that although possible, there was no past history to suggest pulmonary embolism. No post-mortem was done, which would have shown if there was a pulmonary embolism. I accepted the evidence of all the experts regarding the cause of death.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was suggested by Mr Hansell that Dr Dell, Intensive Care Specialist, called to the hospital on 27 September 1998, agreed with Mr Hansell's cause of death stated on the certificate, but Dr Dell denied that and explained that he was in a bit of a rush, so to go through the notes and try to decide the precise cause of death would have taken such a long time. He basically left the responsibility to Mr Hansell. Dr Dale had been sent for on an emergency basis.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Although there were clear signs of sepsis, she died a sudden death in hospital and she should have been referred to the Procurator Fiscal. It is difficult to understand why Mr&nbsp;Hansell, an experienced consultant qualified in 1987 and appointed Consultant in 1992, was apparently unaware of the requirements for reporting the death to the procurator fiscal, when he is practising in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Scotland</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It was said that the death was unexpected. He did not expect her to die suddenly, and felt her sepsis was improving. Further, the death had occurred as the result of a surgical procedure. As such, the death should have been reported to the procurator fiscal for consideration. If the death was clinically unexpected, then it still fell to be reported as a sudden death. Mr Hansell felt that it had been some time since the ERCP and two operations had intervened. None of the experts would have been prepared to certify the death in the circumstances.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>At the time in 1998, the 1998 guidelines &quot;Death and the Procurator Fiscal&quot; had not been published, but guidelines in similar detail were published in 1996 and had been circulated to NHS hospitals, but not private hospitals. Mr Hansell said that no hospital had even given him a copy of &quot;Death and the Procurator Fiscal&quot;. He knew and applied the basic rules for reporting deaths to the Procurator Fiscal.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell made an assumption that a request for a post-mortem would offend the religious views of Mr Haq, a Muslim, and did not make such a request. There should have been a discussion with the family to ascertain the true position, albeit such discussion may have been difficult and inevitably distressing to newly bereaved relatives.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr McFarlane, Pathologist, stated that in her experience as a pathologist, Muslims were one of two main groups of people who consistently for religious reasons are unwilling to consent to post-mortem examinations and sometimes complain if instructions are issued for such examinations. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell stated that he had never asked for a post mortem at Ross Hall before and although he did not know the system, he would have gone to the Director of Nursing who may have had a policy as to procedure.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>As a result of the Shipman Inquiry in </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span lang=EN-GB>, there is a necessity for two GPs to certify a death, but that apparently does not relate to deaths in hospital. Had two doctors been required to certify the death of Mrs Haq, it is unlikely that would have happened in the absence of the post-mortem or a report to the procurator fiscal. Dr Dell, having attended on an emergency basis, left the certification to Mr Hansell. He was not in a position to confirm the cause of death. It would appear that consideration is being given by the authorities in conjunction with the medical profession to widen the scope of the requirement for two doctors to certify a death, to include hospitals. Accordingly, if such consideration is being given it would be inappropriate to make further comment at this time.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The family's concerns could be summarised; that Mr Haq was not fully informed of the exact nature of the problems that arose as a result of the ERCP examination; that the circumstances or cause of Mrs Haq's death were not fully explained to Mr Haq; that there was no discussion about the possibility of having a post-mortem, when there was no religious reason involved; there was concern that she was not transferred to another hospital for specialist treatment; and that Mr Haq had concerns over the quality of the standard of the nursing care and treatment at Ross Hall Hospital in general.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>So far as the explanation relating to the ERCP is concerned, Mr Haq said that he received information from Mr Hansell after the ERCP that &quot;an old ulcer somewhere in her stomach&quot; and that Mrs Haq required an operation. He maintained he was never told there had been an instrumental perforation. That would appear to be correct, as Mr Hansell still maintained that there was a perforated ulcer. He further stated that Mr Hansell told him the operation of </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> was a minor operation, whereas Dr Miller told him it was major. He was very shocked and distressed when Mrs Haq died and felt that the circumstances of her death were not fully explained to him nor was a post-mortem suggested.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>His concerns about the nursing care at Ross Hall mainly centred on his wife having fallen from her chair on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell and Mr Haq agreed that they had a conversation about 2.00 to 2.30 pm on </span><span lang=EN-GB>26 August 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> after the attempted ERCP, when Mr Hansell told Mr Haq he would have to operate. At that time, Mr Hansell had assumed that there was an ulcer. Over the course of the illness, Mr Hansell did speak to Mr Haq on a number of occasions, which is also reflected in the nursing notes. I found it difficult to believe that Mr Hansell had told Mr Haq that the operation of </span><span lang=EN-GB>9 September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> was minor and not a major operation. Mr&nbsp;Dickson's evidence was that Mr Hansell told him (Dr Dickson) that Mrs Haq was not particularly well.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>I have previously dealt with the reasons as to why Mr Hansell did not ask for a post&#8209;mortem. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Haq did not take these matters up until about a year later, when he wrote to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It may have been difficult to decide if his letter was a complaint. He thereafter also consulted a solicitor, who in turn contacted Mr&nbsp;Hamer&#8209;Hodges for an opinion on the notes and the records. Mr Hamer-Hodges advised that the matter should be reported to the procurator fiscal and in recent times he has contacted the GMC with a complaint regarding Mr Hansell.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The family's position is that Mr Hansell deliberately concealed information from Mr Haq and the family and other medical persons attending Mrs Haq and that there was &quot;a cover up&quot;. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>A portion of Mr Charnley's evidence is worth quoting. He says &quot;I have absolutely no doubt that the perforation was caused by the instrument. I do not believe that the cause of the perforation can be put down to a mature ulcer. I would have thought that given Mr&nbsp;Hansell's experience, which he has outlined in his evidence that his conclusion would be the same. Because he fails to recognise this several conclusions can be drawn. One is that the concept of causing a perforation is so alien to his view of himself as a successful consultant that for some reason he has completely blotted it out from his mind and I have known that happen to other doctors where, for some reason, they just cannot appear to accept something that has happened, and that it might possibly be their fault. And so we get into the blurred area as to whether they are maliciously withholding the information or whether they have a mental block in being able to accept it.&quot;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>As previously stated, I did not think that Mr Hansell acted maliciously. It appears that he closed his mind to the obvious finding at laparotomy that there had been an instrumental perforation and maintained his position that there had been an ulcer. Although accepting in evidence that his intervention had caused the hole in the duodenum and that was therefor technically an iatrogenic injury, he did not face up to the fact that there had been an instrumental perforation through a normal duodenum, which was the overwhelming evidence of all the experts. It would be highly probable that belief would not have been maintained if a second opinion had been taken from another consultant or referred to a specialist unit. If Mr Hansell had that erroneous belief, it then becomes quite understandable as to why he wrote in the terms which he did to the GP and the insurance company.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>There may well be an issue of clinical practice as to why an experienced consultant surgeon did not or was not prepared to recognise the true situation as an instrumental perforation. It was critical for the management of the patient, that a perforation of a duodenal ulcer, which is frequently dealt with at district hospital level in a routine, straightforward operation, is one matter, whereas the effects of an instrumental perforation, involving the retroperitoneum, which are notoriously difficult to control after repair and really require the attention of a specialist unit, were quite another matter. It was said a general surgeon would not have much expertise in such a rare case, whereas specialist units would have that experience. Mr Hansell described </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stobhill</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> as being effectively a &quot;</span><span lang=EN-GB>District</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>General</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;Perforated duodenal ulcer&quot; appeared consistently throughout the notes and appeared on the death certificate. It appeared that although there were massive complications in Mrs Haq's condition, re-consideration was not given to the original cause. By a certain point of course, there were very serious complications, irrespective of the original source, which overshadowed everything else.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Hansell, through his counsel, at submissions acknowledged that the transfer of Mrs Haq to an NHS hospital together with greater discussion with other colleagues after Dr&nbsp;Miller left on holiday on 19 September 1998 would have been prudent and might have been of benefit in bringing to bear, in a difficult situation, a variety of options and a collegiate range of experience. If faced in future with a similar situation, he would use his experience of Mrs Haq's management to react more quickly and seek the counsel and assistance of professional colleagues. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It appeared that Mr Hansell was somewhat optimistic and rather selective in his description of Mrs Haq's condition which was fluctuating, and those optimistic views were transmitted to Dr&nbsp;Madhok, GP. No doubt Mr Hansell strongly hoped for Mrs Haq's recovery. However Mrs Haq's condition was notoriously difficult to manage. The approach ought to have been to consider the patient's progress as a whole and make a full and frank report to the GP and inform the family accordingly of the serious situation.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was clear that Mrs Haq was suffering from severe sepsis at least from </span><span lang=EN-GB>22&nbsp;September 1998</span><span lang=EN-GB> onwards and this was minimised in the death certificate as &quot;low grade intra-abdominal sepsis&quot;. That was not a full and frank description of her condition.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>While the final route may have been pulmonary embolism, it was the overwhelming evidence of the experts that it was not the main pathology. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>According to the experts for several days before the death, the warning signs of sepsis were present; Mrs Haq was sore all over and continued to feel unwell; there was confusion, intermittent pyrexia and rigoring; there were significant biochemical abnormalities, and multiple positive blood cultures.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The whole circumstances would tend to indicate the minimisation of her condition and the lack of recognition and acknowledgement of the original cause and subsequent notoriously difficult problems which Mrs Haq encountered thereafter.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The Scottish Audit of Surgical Mortality (SASM) is voluntary, under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Surgeons are encouraged to report deaths there, and it is a way of providing routine objective peer review which may help to avoid problems in cases such as Mrs Haq's. The aim of SASM is more towards trends in surgery than specific criticism, recognising that equal quality of care cannot be provided at all locations by all surgeons at all times. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> now appears to have a system in place to refer all such deaths to SASM. The form requires to be completed by the surgeon. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> impressed as being committed to a high quality of medical treatment and were anxious to comply with SASM. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> supports reporting to SASM and it forwards the relevant forms to surgeons for completion. If a reviewing doctor in SASM is concerned about the circumstances of a death, the case will be referred to a third specialist who scans the records and issues a report to the individual consultant. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Further, evidence was given that there had been additional safeguards introduced since 1998 in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> as part of clinical governance in the health care sector. A number of specialist areas have also set up managed clinical networks to address amongst other matters, guidelines of the transfer of patients to specialist care and to discuss cases of interest and work patterns. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Professor</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Garden</span><span lang=EN-GB> provided an example of the guidance that might be produced regarding the management of complications and the circumstances in which a case should be transferred to a specialist unit. A managed clinical network for upper gastrointestinal and biliary pancreatic surgery has recently been initiated. The network includes all surgeons who are practising in a particular speciality in the regions. Each surgeon reports on their own statistics and discusses his/her own issues and concerns in order to ensure learning from particular cases.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was also stated that every death in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> is reported to the chair of the Medical Advisory Committee at the end of each quarter and includes an outline of the circumstances and whether or not the procurator fiscal has been informed. If there is any doubt about the circumstances of the case the matter is reported to the procurator fiscal. Where the chairman is unclear about the circumstances of the death he will write to the consultant involved. The Medical Advisory Committee considers all hospital deaths and unexpected returns to theatre. Such cases are discussed and any incidents of an above average complication rate is reviewed. There is also a monthly audit of notekeeping and inadequate notekeeping can be grounds for withdrawal of admitting privileges. In the present case there was nothing in the Death Certificate which might have alerted the chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee to consider a report to the Procurator Fiscal. That appears to underline the importance of a consultant being aware of the terms of the publication &quot;Death and the Procurator Fiscal&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was also stated that responses are being made at present to the Shipman Inquiry. Apparently the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB> has given consideration to a recommendation that any death in hospital be certified by two medical practitioners as is presently the case in general practice. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ross</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hall</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>, it was said, would support any recommendations regarding changes on the certification of deaths. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It was also stated in evidence that Ross Hall Hospital expects all consultants to be aware of their obligations in reporting deaths to the procurator fiscal, and that the circumstances in which a death should be reported are highlighted in documentation that is distributed throughout the hospital, which includes the documentation &quot;Death and the Procurator Fiscal&quot;, issued by the Scottish Executive. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>As stated previously, the Scottish Executive had not sent copies of &quot;Death and the Procurator Fiscal&quot; to private hospitals, at the time of Mrs Haq's death.

It would be a matter of fact rather than opinion. At present he said there is no guidance at all for traumatic instrumental perforation.
