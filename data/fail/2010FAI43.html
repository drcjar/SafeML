The marriage had initially been happy, and the couple had 3 children together; namely ****, **** and ****. He had a close bond with his children, and they lived together as a family at 42 Turnberry Wynd Irvine until the marriage broke down.

Mr. Strain gave unclear accounts of why he had done this, but appears to have been resentful of his former wife because of what he perceived to be an unfair financial settlement on divorce, and the denial of contact with his children.

He found Mr Strain to be intelligent and articulate, but with paranoid projection in his thinking processes and a very rigid and uncompromising outlook. His ideas did not amount to delusions, and there was no clear evidence of psychosis. He told Dr Clark that he was not a heavy drinker and had no history of illicit drug use.

His paranoid outlook appeared to be clearly linked to the way he perceived he had been treated in relation to his family situation and divorce settlement.

The watch was then closed, with the result that he was no longer subject to the observation and monitoring regime of prisoners considered to be at risk. Various items of follow-up work were identified and minuted. In particular, one action point was for a follow-up Registered Mental Health nurse assessment to be carried out. As stated by Mr H**** in his evidence, this assessment never took place. Mr H**** as the RMN Nurse, had a responsibility to follow up the action plan within the case conference. He could provide no reason as to why this follow up work was not carried out. No systems were in place to check that all matters identified in the action plan were actually correctly carried out.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

He explained (a) that the Reliance officer in court would pass the documents to the bar officer based in the cell area in the sheriff court (b)&nbsp;that the bar officer would cross reference these documents with Prisoner Escort Records (c) that a third member of staff would copy the documents and input certain data on to a computer system (d) the documents are then passed to the staff known as 'turnkeys' (e) the turnkeys place the documents in a 'docquet' outside a cell - there are up to eight prisoners in a cell and thus the docquet might contain paperwork relating to up to eight prisoners (f) the paperwork is then moved to the bar area ready for the departure of prisoners (g) the van drivers are passed the paperwork. Mr Miller explained that after the cells are emptied, the docquets are checked for any remaining paperwork, but he also accepted that it was possible that some paperwork belonging to one prisoner could be passed to the wrong Reliance van driver.

We will never know at what exact point in the chain the missing psychiatric report went astray, and what became of it. The evidence suggests that the practice Mrs R** W** described is not universally followed, as some prison staff clearly regarded the receipt of such reports as a rarity. However, in relation to the psychiatric report on Mr Strain, I accept Mrs R** W**'s evidence that she passed this to Reliance. She was the only witness who specifically remembered dealing with psychiatric report. Mr. Miller did not remember what paperwork came to Reliance with Mr Strain that day, but thought that Reliance would have received the reports mentioned on the warrant as none were scored out. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

During the intervening period he had been subject to HRAT supervision, and taken off it again as a result of a review of the risks involved by a case conference consisting of health care and welfare professionals. Although no-one at HMP Kilmarnock actually saw the psychiatric report, its salient features were repeated in the SER which was received at the prison.

It must be regarded as unacceptable that the system for flagging up the existence of such important reports, and transmitting them to receiving establishments, is so informal and susceptible to breakdown, misinterpretation or indifference. Some witnesses thought that all the reports mentioned ought to have been with the warrant, but no-one saw fit to query why only an SER had been provided. Other witnesses, on their interpretation of the failure to score out any options, would have assumed that there were none.

As noted above, Russell Clark's evidence was that, on one occasion, he was alerted to the existence of a psychiatric report by a call from the court. Given the potential importance of a psychiatric report to the initial risk assessment process, it is obvious that the prison authorities require to be aware of it as early as possible. There seems to me to be merit in the suggestion that there should be a standardised practice whereby court staff contact the prison in advance to alert them that an incoming prisoner will be accompanied by such a report.

However, it is of concern that no-one made any efforts to try to obtain the psychiatric report itself. In deciding how to factor Dr Clark's assessment into their own risk assessment, they relied on the Social Worker's understanding of what his views were. There is no suggestion that the Social Worker relayed any misinformation or failed to pass on anything of significance in the SER. However, it strikes me as surprisingly casual for mental health professionals to appraise themselves of the conclusions in a consultant psychiatrist's written report on the basis of a non-medical third party's interpretation of what was significant, without attempting to obtain the actual report itself.

Each prisoner is allocated a Personal Officer, and there is a "Listener" scheme involving peer support from a fellow prisoner.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

The new toilet doors with a 10mm diagonal cut were being fitted to cells in new SPS prisons, or during refurbishments in new facilities. However, SPS were not applying this policy retrospectively in public prisons. As far as he was aware, no requirement or request had been made by SPS to private prisons to retrospectively fit such doors to toilets within cells.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

Cell E 25 did not have a shower in the toilet area. Mr Sinclair accepted that it was not impossible to commit suicide even if the new doors are fitted. He accepted that a prisoner could place something at the slanted end to create a suspension point. He agreed that a prisoner could use a lamp (commonly found in cells) as a ligature and the lamp could hang from the slanted door to create a suspension point. He accepted that the piano hinge which attached the door to the wall did not attach to the ceiling thus leaving a gap at the longer end of the door which could still be used as a suspension point, if something such as a belt were to pushed into that gap. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

Although Mr Sinclair accepted that he was not an expert in safety, or the prevention of self harm in prisons, he thought the use of the new slanted door would not stop someone from hanging themselves, but might make it harder. If there was any indication of the risk of self harm, the most appropriate means of preventing self harm would be to place a prisoner in an anti-ligature room in anti-ligature conditions.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

Design innovations are inevitable in any field of building design and construction over a period of time, but whether it is reasonable to adopt any changes prospectively or retrospectively must be a matter for the prison authorities taking into account the factors noted above. The authorities have decided not to embark on a programme of retro-fitting the new cell toilet door. The evidence is that the existing design of cell toilet door is fit for purpose. Accordingly I have no recommendations to make in this regard.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

It is not the function of an Inquiry to make any findings of fault or to apportion blame. Questions of what might or might not have been reasonably foreseeable are for consideration elsewhere and are not appropriate to this forum. The statutory provisions are widely drawn and are intended to permit retrospective consideration of matters with the benefit of hindsight. Causation is relevant in determining what findings can be made under section 6 (1)(c) or (d), but section 6(1)(e) permits consideration of any other facts which are relevant to the circumstances of the death, even though a causal link has not been established.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

The case conferences were aware of the salient conclusion of the missing psychiatric report, and were able to take this into account in their assessment of risk. The death occurred some 5 months after Mr Strain was admitted to prison, during which time prison staff and mental health professionals had the benefit of their own observations. SERCO's own report made recommendations to improve the quality of daily narratives on prisoners. There is no evidence that any redesign of the cell door would have been likely to divert Mr. Strain from the course which he ultimately took. There was no evidence of any warning signs that Mr Strain was contemplating taking his own life, and prison staff and his cell mate were taken completely by surprise. In relation to the HRAT process, all the signs seem to have been that Mr Strain was coping with life in prison. For the reasons given, I have concluded that Mr Strain took his life impulsively and there were no reasonable precautions by which it might have been prevented. Although I have identified some defects in systems of working which ought to be addressed, it is not possible to conclude that these contributed to the death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
