</span><span lang=EN-GB>20th February 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Fraser John O'Donnell, a twenty three year old student attempted suicide. At the time, in part, he attributed events in his life as being a cause. He sought medical assistance at the Victoria Infirmary Glasgow, accident and emergency department but left before treatment. He was found, brought to the department, treated and was referred appropriately to a community mental health facility at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>After an incomplete initial mental health assessment by a relatively inexperienced occupational therapist and a very experienced community psychiatric nurse, Fraser was designated to be seen by that occupational therapist. The designation was made by that community psychiatric nurse, after consultation, on the basis that she was next on the rota. The designation was agreed to by a subsequent multi disciplinary team meeting. Fraser was seen by the occupational therapist five times prior to his death. In that time no focussed treatment plan was formulated; the assessment drifted. It is not good practice to continue an assessment over an extended period where no treatment plan is identified. Fraser reported to his family that his treatment was not working. Fraser did not tell the occupational therapist this. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>From the last two meetings with Fraser, a more experienced clinician would have realised from what Fraser was saying that he was not improving and may have been worsening, but this was not realised by the occupational therapist. This was an error of judgement which may have been due, in part, to her relative inexperience. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There were two means of supervision of the occupational therapist at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>; weekly multi disciplinary team meetings and supervision by a senior occupational therapist every six weeks. The dual supervision system had a weakness in that the weekly meetings were not designed to address the experience of a member of the team, and supervision by a senior when Fraser was there was only a case loading meeting There appeared to be no linkage between the two systems. During the period of Fraser's attendance at Florence Street that combination of supervision was inadequate, but it has not been established whether that was due to the weakness in the system or a failure to operate the system sufficiently, or both. While the way in which Fraser was dealt with at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> was a method of proceeding used by community mental health facilities such as </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, the drift should have been identified by the multi disciplinary team. The error of judgement should also have been identified, but only by a date close to Fraser's death. It has not been established, and it would be speculative to determine, that on discovery of the error of judgement, a change of approach would have resulted prior to Fraser's death, the alternative suggested by an expert being that Fraser be seen by a more experienced clinician for a second opinion. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>On the evening of </span><span lang=EN-GB>30<sup>th</sup> March 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the early morning of </span><span lang=EN-GB>31<sup>st</sup> March 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> some events caused Fraser to be very upset. Fraser had consumed alcohol. Fraser was aware that alcohol should be avoided by him as it tended to make his suicidal ideation worse. Later in the morning of </span><span lang=EN-GB>31<sup>st</sup> March 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> Fraser made a further attempt on his life in the same manner as before. He did not succeed. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>He telephoned an ambulance and he was taken to the Victoria Infirmary, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Glasgow</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The ambulance staff found an open bottle of wine beside him at his flat and he smelled of alcohol. He was coherent and he co-operated. Against the terms of a written hospital protocol, Fraser was not physically received by hospital staff when there was a handover by the ambulance technician. Hospital staff told the ambulance technician to bring Fraser into the department and seat him in the general waiting area. It was a very rare occurrence for attempt suicide patients to be placed in the general waiting area, as they are generally kept in the treatment area so that they can be observed. Fraser complied with the instruction from the ambulance technician. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Fraser was told by ambulance staff that someone would attend to him, shortly or in a couple of minutes, by which the ambulance staff meant that he would be triaged (assessed for priority of treatment). The effect of the instruction from the hospital staff was that Fraser was unlikely to have been seen shortly (triaged). Had there been a triage process, it could have taken up to half an hour to do, depending on pressure of business. In a period of fifteen minutes while Fraser was sitting in the general waiting area, Fraser texted his girlfriend four times to say he was still waiting to be seen. After fifteen minutes, Fraser had not been seen by hospital staff and he left the hospital. Fraser's treatment card was noticed by the consultant on duty in a box in the treatment area for cards of those waiting to be treated. He did so about half an hour after Fraser had entered the department. He called Fraser for treatment. There was no reply. The consultant made efforts to find Fraser. Those efforts were unsuccessful. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Later that day, Fraser, with alcohol in his system and a broken bottle of alcohol nearby, killed himself by stepping in front of a moving train.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Notwithstanding the drift of the assessment, the error of judgement of the occupational therapist in not recognising the depth of Fraser's illness, the weakness in the systems at Florence Street, the inadequate supervision of the occupational therapist at Florence Street on that occasion, and the failure to observe the protocol by hospital staff, on the evidence led at the inquiry, it has not been established that, any of these circumstances caused or contributed to Fraser's death or were facts relevant to the death, and no findings are made in respect of the sections 6(1)(c-e) of the Act.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Fraser's parents considered that that they had not received satisfactory explanations from those managing Fraser's care and sought this inquiry.

He appeared to be in good spirits and reported that the academic pressure had lessened to some extent.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=8 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>On </span><span lang=EN-GB>20<sup>th</sup> February 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> Fraser attempted suicide by cutting his writs with a knife in his flat.

Fraser's girlfriend and her mother took Fraser to the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow to the accident and emergency department. Fraser expressed embarrassment at the situation he found himself in, including that he regretted that he had been unable to kill himself successfully. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=9 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Fraser was registered in the accident and emergency department as a patient and was spoken to by staff in the department but left before treatment was completed.

She deleted the words "urgent" and "next day" from her pro forma assessment which indicated that she considered Fraser was not at high risk of suicide.

Likewise, the psychiatrist member of the team had no responsibility as regards the qualification, training and supervision of the community psychiatric nurses or occupational therapists.

Mrs Scott  did not know anything of the qualifications of or training of Mrs Petrie because Mrs Scott was a nurse and Mrs Petrie was an occupational therapist.

No person chaired the meetings of the team and no one person was accountable for the decisions of the team. No detailed record or minute was kept of the discussions had, and decisions taken, at the weekly meetings. It was not mandatory that all members of the team were present. Team members could be absent because of annual leave and other commitments. If team members were at work on the Friday they generally attended the meeting. The weekly meeting took precedence in the hierarchy of decision making, but the system was such that the competence of a member of the team to carry out duties was taken on trust, the issue of competence, supervision of skills, supervision of the competence to make clinical decisions, and of competence of decisions generally being left, in the case of Mrs Petrie to her senior supervisor, Mr. McGhee to be dealt with.

The consequence was that a clinician coming to Fraser's case notes would have been hampered in his progress of the case by the absence of information.

While Fraser's disclosures on </span><span lang=EN-GB>14<sup>th</sup> March 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB> were after the weekly meeting that day, Fraser was reviewed at the weekly meeting of </span><span lang=EN-GB>28<sup>th</sup> March 2008</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Mrs Petrie did not recognise that Fraser continued to be mentally unwell with the possibility of his condition worsening. That was an error of judgement on her part. Her relative inexperience and lack of training may have played a part in her failure to recognise and act on the signs of illness and suicidal ideation that were present. Had Fraser been adequately reviewed that day, a more experienced clinician should have been recommended to see Fraser with Mrs Petrie. Fraser had been reluctant to see anyone other than Mrs Petrie, and had declined to see anyone else when she was on leave. It is uncertain whether he would have agreed to such a proposal. Had Fraser been prepared to see a more experienced clinician, he or she would have identified that Fraser remained unwell and that his suicidal thoughts were ongoing and may be worsening.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

As a result, Mrs Petrie's experience was not addressed by them. The practical result of the system was that she lead the discussion. Her opinion was taken on trust. The team took no steps to raise themselves the progress of Fraser at weekly meetings, it being left to Mrs Petrie to do so. Further, the nature of the supervision by her senior during the period was inadequate in that the only supervision by her superior during that time was a case loading exercise. The result was that the handling of Fraser's case was allowed to drift which was not good practice and Mrs Petrie's inability to realise the extent of Fraser's illness was not picked up. While Fraser believed that he was being treated and that the treatment was not working, in reality Mrs Petrie was continuing with her assessment, trying to know Fraser better so that she could give him support, monitoring his risk of suicide and gathering information to formulate a treatment plan.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The treatment facilities in terms of consulting and treatment areas and availability of clinical staff to assess and treat patients results in different levels of demand. At times the facilities can be overwhelmed and determination of the level of priority of treatment is often required. At the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency department there was in 2008 and is a need to assess priorities. There was therefore in place a system for assessing priorities. Persons attending the accident and emergency department may either self refer by appearing in person at reception in the accident and emergency department or they can be brought to the department by ambulance. In general terms persons brought by ambulance are considered to be likely to be in need of emergency or urgent treatment. On arrival, persons self presenting provide their details to a receptionist at a desk located in front of a general waiting area. After completion of a record card relative to the patient's attendance at the department and the card distributed, he is referred to a triage nurse for assessment. The patient is asked to sit in the general waiting area pending assessment by the triage nurse. </span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=85 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Persons arriving by ambulance are triaged or assessed by the clinical staff within the treatment area of the department.</span></li></ol><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><ol style='margin-top:0pt' start=86 type=1><li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>When a patient is brought to the department by ambulance there requires to be a transfer of the patient from the ambulance team to the hospital staff who are to treat the patient.

While it may be inevitable from what I have gleaned in passing, I have a concern also about forming views on the performance of individuals where they have not been called as witnesses. As an example, there was scrutiny of the robustness of the performance of the multi disciplinary team in weekly meeting, but the only evidence of that performance is that of Mrs Petrie whose own actions was under scrutiny. Mrs Scott spoke of such meetings but there was some uncertainty which if any meetings she attended during that period. About the events at the Victoria Infirmary there was evidence from the two ambulance staff, but none of the staff from the accident and emergency department gave evidence other than Dr. Gordon.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Further, the submissions of Miss Ritchie, Mr Paterson and Mr. Kurana contained strongly asserted themes about the absence of comparative and expert evidence, which meant that there was little evidential basis for identifying defects in systems or reasonable precautions.

Broadly, I agree with such submissions. It follows from that, that while I found Mr Fordyce's submissions to be pertinent to the issues his client wished to be raised, on analysis of the evidence before the inquiry, there was not sufficient evidence to support many of his submissions.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The only independent comparative or expert evidence came from Dr. Finlayson.

As far as I can see Dr. Marshall was not asked why he did not chase up the letter. He did say that he was awaiting their letter. Of course, the evidence was that the assessment was ongoing and was not concluded and Mrs Petrie said that the letter was due within 25 working days of the referral. In submission Mr Fordyce criticised that practice. I do not recall the 25 day timescale being put to Dr. Jones Edwards or Dr. Finlayson as an issue. Mrs Scott said that it was twenty eight days. It would be of use if all practitioners were aware of the time scales. I comment elsewhere that the time scale is pretty remote but the issue of suggesting an alternative should be based on evidence, and I cannot recall an alternative being suggested in evidence of weight. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB>Next of kin recording</span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I heard evidence from Dr. Marshall about the procedure for a new patient registering with his practice.

Dr. Gordon telephoned Dr. Marshall urgently because he knew nothing of Fraser and wanted information.

However, to Dr. Marshall the call from an accident and emergency consultant was highly unusual and yet he thought there was no urgency in it, yet he tried to contact Fraser nonetheless. Dr. Gordon was reassured as to the risk to Fraser who had attempted suicide by being told that he was engaging in treatment where such treatment would include suicide prevention, which, on the facts, on one view, could not have been working. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Gordon could not remember whether he asked Dr. Marshall if he, Dr. Gordon, should phone the police.

Accordingly, she had been exposed to mental health conditions of various sorts for various purposes before meeting Fraser. The extent of her expertise from that exposure depended on what she had learned, and that in turn depended to some extent on her being trained, mentored and supervised during the period.

While Dr. Jones Edwards identified the weekly meeting as the pre-eminent source of clinical supervision and decision making, it was not explained in evidence how the supervisory role of the weekly meeting was to interact with the supervisory role of Mr. McGhee. It appeared to be accepted, as shown by the manner of questioning by all at the inquiry, that during the period of Fraser's referral, for the six weekly supervisory meeting there was substituted the case loading meeting. There was no evidence of when the previous supervisory meeting by her senior had taken place and when the next one was due. What was demonstrated in evidence was that the management structures and operation at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> allowed a relatively inexperienced practitioner in matters of community mental health assessment and treatment to be without sufficient supervision over the critical period. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It appears that because the team operated on a basis of trust in the competence of each other, they were content to allow Mrs Petrie to take the initiative. It was her decision not to bring the matter back to the meeting until 28<sup>th</sup> March. Her evidence was that routine reviews were four weekly, hence 28<sup>th</sup> March and the end of April. It appears therefore that she considered Fraser to be a routine case. Standing her experience and standing also that the meeting were aware that the assessment had not been completed, it points to the need for someone at that weekly meeting to have been asking her whether the assessment was now complete, what it revealed, and how matters were progressing, and what the treatment plan was. Who at the weekly meeting should have asked the question? On the evidence, everyone including Mrs Petrie should have been asking that question. The lack of one person being accountable or in charge at the meetings arises. I heard no comparative or expert evidence, and no alternative way of proceeding was suggested. All I can say, therefore, from the evidence that the inquiry heard, is that it is likely that, in reality, no one assumed responsibility, notwithstanding the theory that they were all responsible. If all members of the team are equally respected and valued, it may be very difficult for a member of the team to suggest that another member of the team is unqualified to deal with a patient, or has not done something well due to inexperience, or that the assessment is drifting; especially so if there is shared responsibility.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The other issue, in which Mrs Petrie's experience was said to be a factor, was, according to Dr. Finlayson whose evidence I accept, that Mrs Petrie did not see danger signals in what Fraser was saying, particularly on 14<sup>th</sup> March and later on 28<sup>th</sup> March. I accept that there were danger signals there. His view was that someone more experienced would have seen these signals and called someone else in for, in effect, a second opinion.<b> </b>However, while it was not fully looked at in evidence, it appears from Mrs Petrie's notes, that Mrs Petrie's appointment with Fraser on 14<sup>th</sup> March was after the weekly meeting and she was on leave for a week thereafter. The nature of the difficulty identified by Dr Finlayson was probably not starkly evident therefore until after the weekly meeting on 14<sup>th</sup> March. Accordingly, while the multi disciplinary team should have asked whether the assessment had been completed on 14<sup>th</sup> March, there would have been little if any information available to them from which to conclude that Fraser's condition was not improving and may have been worsening, until 28<sup>th</sup> March.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Apparently, it did not occur to Mrs Petrie to raise Fraser's state with anyone after her meeting with Fraser on the 14<sup>th</sup> March. While Dr. Finlayson was not asked specifically, it may be inferred that Dr. Finlayson did not see the discoveries at the meeting with Fraser on 14<sup>th</sup> March as so urgent as to merit Mrs. Petrie taking immediate steps, such as calling in the crisis team. Had Mrs Petrie realised the depth of Fraser's illness, Dr. Finlayson's recommended course of action was for her to call in a second opinion, presumably at the next meeting with Fraser. This would have happened, at the earliest, on 28<sup>th</sup> March. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It may well have been therefore that a review of notes with a supervisor could not have occurred until between 24<sup>th</sup> March and 28<sup>th</sup> March, (the length of her leave was not detailed). If there had been a review meeting with Mr. McGhee, her senior, that may have taken place at some time during that week; if by the multi disciplinary team, again it was likely to have been at the meeting on the morning of 28<sup>th</sup> March. There was in fact a review of Fraser's case on the 28<sup>th</sup> March in the morning, but the decision taken was that Mrs Petrie was to continue as she had been doing. I mention this to put the lapse of time in context, but I recognise that this aspect of matters was not explored in evidence in detail. Fraser was due to be seen at that afternoon's appointment. It was possible therefore that had a different decision been taken, had there been adequate supervision, someone from the crisis team or other more experienced clinician may have been available to sit in on that meeting, if felt appropriate. As Fraser had declined, in the past, to see anyone other than Mrs. Petrie, it does not follow necessarily that Fraser would have agreed to see that other more experienced clinician, even with Mrs. Petrie, that day, or at any later date.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Jones Edwards said that Mrs Petrie's notation was exemplary.

As Dr. Finlayson said and I accept, the notes of 14<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> March give a vivid picture of someone whose mental health/unwellness appeared not to be improving and may have been worsening. In my view, the notation is not the issue. The issue is that the notes disclosed a situation which Mrs Petrie did not see. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It was maintained in submission that there was no justification in Dr. Finlayson's assertion that Mrs Petrie was inadequately qualified, trained and experienced to proceed without adequate supervision.

There was no evidence from an occupational therapist expert or other mental health professional, other than Dr. Finlayson and Dr. Jones Edwards, about whether her qualifications, training and experience of community mental health would entitle her to be described as experienced and competent to see Fraser. Dr. Jones Edwards maintained that Mrs Petrie was highly qualified and highly experienced. She was not asked to elaborate by reference to Mrs Petrie's actual qualifications, training and experience. She strongly asserted this in a defensive manner. I preferred the more measured and reasoned assessment of Dr. Finlayson. Dr. Finlayson heard most of Mrs Petrie's evidence where Dr. Jones Edwards did not. He, too, saw the notation. I am prepared to accept his assessment that she was relatively inexperienced in the assessing and treating Fraser's condition. He explained that even the most experienced of clinicians can make mistakes and wrong clinical decisions; his position was that Mrs Petrie had done so in Fraser's case, and that her relative inexperience may have had a part to play in not realising that Fraser was more unwell than she thought. I accept that assessment.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Fordyce submitted that there was a failure to communicate with Fraser's family and doctor to share the risk.

Dr. Finlayson indicated that communication with the family was not done as a matter of current practice. He favoured communication with the family or other reliable source of information about a patient. That would depend on a case by case consideration. In general, it appears that communication with family may not be the current practice.

While I appreciate, of course, that the procurator fiscal leads at the inquiry, those representing </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> had the opportunity to do so, had they wished. The evidence showed that the system at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florence Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> splits responsibility between the weekly meeting and the occupational therapist supervisor with no link between the two. As an example, it was not suggested that Mr. McGhee ever sat in on any weekly meeting as part of his responsibility for Mrs Petrie.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>While the critical clinical investigation action plan might suggest otherwise, I took from the evidence Dr. Jones Edwards that were someone like Fraser to appear in Florence Street again, as little has changed, the manner in which Fraser was dealt with could happen again.

Mr Kurana submitted that the inquiry, having no clinical experience, should be slow to comment. I agree to an extent and therefore my comments should be general. If a supervisor is to be fully accountable for the performance of someone like Mrs Petrie, then the system has to be robust enough to work in practice and to be fair to the supervisor. That may mean more frequent and longer meetings depending on the experience of the practitioner. It may mean that the supervisor has to attend the weekly meetings the team or meet weekly with someone in Mrs Petrie's position. Dr. Finlayson spoke of consultant psychiatrists meeting weekly with trainee and junior staff. Such a frequency might be looked at. I fully accept that such matters have resource and other ramifications. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>On the other hand if, as Mrs Scott and Dr. Jones Edwards said, the primary responsibility for clinical supervision is the multi disciplinary team at weekly meeting, it seems that shared accountability may have the practical result of there being no accepted responsibility by anyone. I am conscious that I heard little evidence about what happened at the weekly meetings where Fraser was discussed. Nonetheless, it seems to me that one person fixed with the responsibility of being accountable for the decisions of the team in weekly meeting would bring a focus to the decision making of the team.

Dr. Finlayson mentioned what he referred to, perhaps historically, as a snobbery on the part of the specialist. While it did not feature particularly with Fraser, it could well be that a general medical practitioner has a great deal of knowledge of the patient or indeed, mental health expertise that could be of assistance. In the current case there was a very experienced community general medical practitioner with some knowledge of his young patient and who formed tentative view that Fraser was suffering from "neurotic depression reactive type" and, "good going biological depression. Recent suicide attempt. Not suicidal currently", handing over that patient to a non medically qualified, relatively inexperienced occupational therapist who was still assessing Fraser five weeks after referral. It was said by the psychiatrists that coming to a premature diagnosis, conclusion or formulation of, or labelling, the patient's condition can be unhelpful; failing to form any view after five weeks would appear to be unhelpful also. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>An aspect of connectivity is the fact that a general medical practitioner may well not see a patient and get a first letter as much as 25 working days after referral.

Mrs Petrie was asked about talking therapies and whether they applied to Fraser's treatment. She replied that her main focus was to monitor his mental health, all as has been set out above. Dr. Finlayson said in evidence that he detected no treatment plan for Fraser prepared by Mrs Petrie either as spoken to by her in evidence or in her notes.

Accordingly the evidence required to be considered in depth.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I could reconcile the evidence of the police officer and it absence of detail because she was performing a peripheral function and was conveying a general impression. Miss Taylor explained towards the end of her evidence that she remembered Fraser because shortly after his death one of her family had commented that she had known Fraser. I accept that.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>I thought Miss Taylor's account of the events was truthful and reliable. For the reasons set out below I also accept that M/s Hausley is a truthful and reliable. I did not consider that M/s Hausley and Miss Taylor had made up elements of their evidence to cover for something done or not done by them. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Now the evidence of M/s Hausley and M/s Taylor was to the effect that M/s Hausley entered accident and emergency while M/s Taylor stayed outside while Fraser smoked a cigarette, and that they met each other just inside the door of accident and emergency when M/s Hausley told Fraser and M/s Taylor that the clinical team had instructed that Fraser was to be seated in the general waiting area. What M/s Hausley did when entering accident and emergency was her evidence alone. While no evidence was led to contradict M/s Hausley and no challenge was made to her evidence it is important to look at the possible happenings that day. M/s Hausley could have handed in the PRF to reception and returned to tell Fraser that he was to sit and wait in the general waiting area. I do not accept such a scenario. She said that that did not happen and that to do so was against the training she had received. I considered that she was credible and reliable on this point. To believe that she simply handed in the PRF to reception would be a gross neglect of duty and I do not believe that that would have happened. Further, it is at odds with the careful and professional manner in which both gave treatment to Fraser at the flat and in the ambulance.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>That being the case, it is more likely than not that what she said happened did in fact happen, namely that she went to the desk in treatment area reported that Fraser was outside and asked what the Victoria Infirmary staff wanted to do with him. It was clear from the other evidence that Fraser's physical injuries had been cleaned and were unlikely to need attention. The only reason therefore for having him there was to monitor his mental state. M/s Hausley gave full information about this being a repeat attempt and that Fraser was attending at a community mental health facility.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Miss Taylor spoke separately about verbal handovers occurring on occasions. I accept that evidence as being truthful and reliable. Both M/s Hausley and Miss Taylor were of the view that verbal handovers were not against any Scottish Ambulance service instruction and not against Victoria Infirmary practice. It came to this, that it was better if you could to hand over physically if possible.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>If M/s Hausley spoke to anyone in the clinical team that day, as I hold she did, then whoever that person was, allowed a verbal handover to take place. A verbal handover is not in accordance with the written protocol and the practice of the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency department. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The organisation of the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency relied on the protocol operating, namely physical handovers. Because Fraser was an ambulance case, it would be assumed that he had been assessed for priority. That meant that he did not require to be triaged in the manner that a self referral was. Accordingly, once Fraser's card was produced, it would have gone to the treatment area and been put in a box.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Fraser was told by M/s Hausley that he would be seen shortly, there was also reference in the evidence to in a couple of minutes. That suggests he was told that there would be a triage process. In the circumstances triage would not have happened. I accept also that it can take up to thirty minutes to call someone for triage. Fraser left before that. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>From what Dr. Gordon said in evidence he had made enquiry of his staff and no one could remember Fraser being mentioned or remember giving instructions to place him in the general waiting area. I believe Dr. Gordon's evidence that the placing an attempt suicide patient in the general waiting area is a very rare occurrence, and yet no one remembered giving the instruction. The decision to place Fraser in the general waiting area, being so rare, it does call on the person making the decision to explain it and there is no explanation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>In these circumstances, I consider what happened that day should not have happened. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Of course, Fraser had left the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency on an earlier occasion. We do not know if he departed from the treatment area on that occasion; he was a self referral patient on that day and would have attended the general waiting area initially. On 31<sup>st</sup> March, Fraser would have known that his wounds did not require much if any treatment. He would have known that the reason for being there might involve a further mental health assessment. He had already stated repeatedly that his mental health treatment was not working. Viewed from his perspective there was little to keep him there. <b></b>That may have<b> </b>contributed to Fraser's decision to leave the Victoria Infirmary, but on the evidence it cannot be said that it is probable that it was.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Miss Taylor spoke of patients such as Fraser being in an unstable state and being taken to hospital for that reason. In the absence of a clear explanation for the decision, leaving Fraser alone in such a situation has not been justified. It demonstrated lack of appropriate care of Fraser at the time. It is speculation, however, to suggest he would not have left anyway. All that can be said is that there may have been a better chance that he would have been seen to do so, and/or his absence noted sooner had he remained in the treatment area, otherwise why was it the practice to keep him there.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>In summary, it is speculation to suggest that (a) his experience of the Victoria Infirmary on 31<sup>st</sup> March 2008 contributed to his decision to kill himself, (b) he would not have left in any event, (c) on leaving, had the doctors acted differently, it is likely that he would have been found, (d) that anything done with Fraser at the Victoria Infirmary that day had he stayed was likely to have prevented his death, for there was no evidence to explain why Fraser killed himself.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>It was submitted that the written protocol of the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency department did not necessarily exclude a verbal handover and on one view of the document that is arguable. It was not suggested by Dr. Gordon that that was the case; he was clear that his staff worked on the basis of a physical handover. He was not challenged on his view that there required to be a physical handover. For the avoidance of doubt the terms of the protocol, should be revisited to eliminate any ambiguity.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB>Connectivity and communication Victoria Infirmary</span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The strength of the protocol of a department is only as sound as those who operate them.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>There would have been a better chance of their not being a verbal handover, if both the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency management had agreed upon identical protocols reinforced by regular training of both services about them requiring there to be a physical handover in all attempt suicide cases.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Gordon spoke of there being regular management meetings to tighten up procedures.

Dr. Gordon said that he felt personally that he had let Fraser down. He told the inquiry that steps have been taken, but that what happened could happen again. That is not very reassuring. I accept that there is an interaction between the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Victoria Infirmary in the handover of patients and that therefore there has to be a negotiation and agreement as to how to proceed. I accept too that being an emergency service there can be occasions where all presenting may have life threatening conditions. I accept, too, that the physical treatment of Fraser was unlikely to be in that category. That does not prevent the Victoria Infirmary accident and emergency department from taking steps where possible to look at the matter again. I do consider that if, as the inquiry was told, placing an attempt suicide in the general waiting area is very rare occurrence, then it may not be seen as being unduly burdensome for the protocol to be amended to require a staff member taking the decision to place an attempt suicide patient in the general waiting area to require that person to sign the PDF to that effect, although no one suggested that in evidence. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>The manner in which the state health care services dealt with Mr O'Donnell and M/s Hill, their enquiries and issues in the correspondence are not part of the remit of this inquiry, although the inquiry saw some of the correspondence. I detected in some of that correspondence, (but detected less in the evidence of witnesses at the inquiry), some suggestion that Fraser was negative at times. Overall, the evidence showed that, from return to hospital on 20<sup>th</sup> February, Fraser was not negative; he was co-operative, but he was a deeply troubled young man with unstable emotions and, understandably, was and was likely to be confused about what he wanted to and should do. His troubled state was why he sought the care and assistance that the medical care services were there to provide. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Fordyce made a fitting closing submission, "I would like to pay tribute to Fraser's parents who have endured this inquiry with quiet dignity.
