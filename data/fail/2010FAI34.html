  150%'>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> in late December 2005. I say "might" with good reason as will be explained later. The Inquiry has left a feeling, and her family will certainly feel, that Mrs Forrest was let down at various times and in various ways during her stay in Queen Margaret Hospital which had some degree of responsibility for her welfare, health and safety. Whether or not she was let down and, if she was, whether or not any of it contributed to her death remains a question that this Inquiry has not been able to fully answer. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>One of the few positive things to come out of this Inquiry is that NHS Fife has apparently taken a long and detailed look at procedures and practices and taken some steps to try to ensure that a similar situation does not arise again. Only time will tell. However, it was significant that although some of these procedures and practices were spoken about in evidence, some witnesses seemed to have had little to do with any internal investigation or review or the preparation of the documents put to them. Their contribution, at times, seemed to be little more than a signature at the foot of a document. How new protocols or practices were prepared or by whom remains, in part at least, shrouded in mystery. I have to wonder if the Inquiry may not have been better served if some of the people who actually did the work had also given evidence. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is also concerning that despite evidence from managers about what has been done to disseminate information, policies and procedures and their aspirations in that regard, there was clear evidence from witnesses, both nursing and medical, that some of them were unaware of some of certain policies or documents. It is also important to acknowledge that NHS Fife took steps at a relatively early date to write to the family accepting that their care of Mrs Forrest was not what it might have been (production 9). That response came following a complaint by the family and an internal investigation. Both the letter and the result of the investigation were spoken to by witnesses. They are relevant to the Inquiry and I reject any suggestion that they are not. I found the suggestion in the submission for the NHS that I should pay little heed to that letter and investigation quite puzzling.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is not acceptable that this Fatal Accident Inquiry started more than three years after Mrs&nbsp;Forrest's death. I exempt from criticism in respect of this delay the current District Procurator Fiscal and Miss Yusaf, who conducted the Inquiry on behalf of the Crown as it is clear that when they became involved and got to grips with the matter, it proceeded, although not without difficulty. Quite why those responsible up until the latter part of 2008 took few steps to hold this, or indeed, certain other Inquiries, is something which I had hoped the Crown would investigate. However it is clear to me from the court programme that this shortcoming has been addressed since we embarked on this Inquiry in February 2009. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It also became clear during the course of evidence that there were some witnesses who were not on the original list and who may have had some useful contribution to make. In the end of the day we did hear from some of these witnesses and there was further delay while they were identified and traced. In some cases there was a suspicion that their identity and the identity of "witnesses" from whom we did not hear evidence may have been known to one or more of the representatives at the Inquiry. The identity of a junior doctor from whom we did not hear despite her apparent involvement remains a mystery. Long term sick leave for two of the witnesses did not help matters progress.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>If the purpose of a Fatal Accident Inquiry is to investigate <b>all</b> the circumstances pertaining to a death then perhaps there should be an obligation on <b>all </b>parties who participate in the Inquiry to disclose relevant evidence and witnesses. As it was we did not hear from a staff nurse on the previous shift who had almost certainly had something to do with admission to Ward 8 and may have been able to assist in ascertaining what was known and when about possible staff shortages and what, if anything, was done about it. He may also have answered questions about the admission documentation and, particularly what was said about risk assessment, mobility, risk of falls etc and how much attention was paid to what had been put in the A &amp; E notes. I regard the absence of that evidence as crucial and that lack of the evidence has been a hindrance in reaching a satisfactory determination.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>We did not hear from two nursing auxiliaries on the ward who <b>may</b> have seen Mrs Forrest wandering around and <b>may</b> have seen a "fall" or a slip. We did not hear from a porter who was said to have brought Mrs Forrest back to the ward after she was wandering about in a corridor. She may even have been found on the floor in the corridor. We do not know. As a result we cannot be certain how many falls, slips or trips Mrs Forrest may have had during her short stay on Ward 8, whether they were seen and, if they were, why they were not recorded. There was some evidence that various falls or slips had been mentioned to the internal investigation after Mrs Forrest's death but that is the extent of the evidence. Once again I regard the lack of this first hand evidence as a hindrance in reaching a satisfactory determination. It has a crucial bearing on matters such as risk assessment and observation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>We did not hear from a nursing expert and, given the criticism of certain nursing practices, that is, in my view, a critical omission which seriously restricts the findings and comments about nursing practice. It also limits any recommendations that might be made about nursing practice.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>One of the issues raised in submissions was whether or not the death certificate accurately reflected the cause of death and there were submissions that should be changed. However, the pathologist, Dr Brooks Lim, was very clear in her evidence and would not be shifted despite some rigorous cross-examination and there was no contrary pathology evidence. Views were expressed by certain medical witnesses but none had pathology experience and some even said that they would have to defer to the pathologist which makes interference with her conclusions difficult.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs Forrest's family cannot have got closure knowing that this Inquiry was on the horizon and that there were issues they wished aired. They were present throughout proceedings and I would commend them for the dignified and restrained approach they have taken to matters despite the, at times, disorganised nature of the proceedings none of which was attributable to anything they said or did.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I would also wish to express my dismay at the length of time this Inquiry has taken over so many months. Some part of the delay is attributable to the Crown's early inactivity, lack of full preparation and other factors as mentioned above but, there were other issues. It was, for example, clear to me from a very early stage that there was, at the very least, potentially, a conflict of interest in those seeking to represent NHS Fife and the various doctors and nurses. I raised this even before the Inquiry started and again several times after it was in progress. I was constantly assured by Counsel that there was no such conflict and that Counsel would and could continue to represent all of these parties. Eventually, after the doctors had given evidence, solicitors appeared seeking to represent, separately, the interests of the doctors and the nurses. That was, in my view both appropriate and necessary from the point of view of the doctors and nurses but it should have been identified earlier and it did contribute to the delay. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Equally, I have no idea why the various nurses and doctors did not take steps at an earlier stage to at least consider if they needed representation. I presume that intimation was made to them or that at the very least they may have considered their positions when witness citations were served. As I noted earlier there was also the suspicion and suggestion that there had not been in some cases much co-operation to trace witnesses whose identity had, until it emerged in evidence, been unknown to the Crown. The Crown maintained in submission it had asked for information regarding certain potential witnesses. The NHS maintained it had no record of that. The fact remains that we did not hear from certain "witnesses". The Inquiry is incomplete without that evidence. If there has been any deliberate withholding of information regarding witnesses that would be unacceptable but I do not know whether or not that is the case.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>As it is, not only will the Forrest family feel it has been let down by the system of health care in Queen Margaret Hospital in late 2005, it will also feel it has been let down by the legal system and, in so far as I can do so, I apologise to them for that. At times my frustration at the delays and lack of progress has been a little too obvious but my frustration would be as nothing compared with that which must have been felt by the family. The current system of Fatal Accident Inquiries is under review and there are many aspects of this Inquiry which I would hope might assist in that task if only to show how many things can go wrong.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is also appropriate to commend in particular, Mrs Mary Forrest who, after giving her evidence, adopted the role of advocate for the family. It was a role she performed extremely well and with considerable skill asking many searching and important questions. It cannot have been easy for her going over, time and again, the very sad events which led to the untimely death of her mother-in-law. There were issues she wished to be aired and she made sure they were aired. I am aware that her participation meant she faced certain difficulties and inconveniences in her own life and work. I hope there have not been any unwanted consequences arising from her participation in the Inquiry. I would simply like to record my personal appreciation of the work she put into the Inquiry and the great skill with which she conducted it. Her contribution was invaluable. Her submissions were, in places, controversial and were not in their entirety relevant to the ambit of this Inquiry and in relation to certain aspects of them I would urge that she exercise considerable caution.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The fact remains that in making this determination I must rely on evidence. I cannot reach conclusions based on what we did not hear or on matters which arose purely from hearsay evidence and without any other support. This was a Fatal Accident Inquiry under the 1976 Act and not a wide reaching public enquiry and there are matters which the family felt were important and relevant which I cannot deal with in this determination. I suspect therefore that the publication of this determination may do only a little towards bringing complete closure for them.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>After various preliminary hearings, the Inquiry commenced hearing evidence and sat on 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 February, 24, and </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>25 March 2009</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>. In April 2009 the very obvious conflict of interest having at last been recognised, approaches were made by solicitors representing the doctors and nurses who sought to represent their interests. We also required an interpreter to assist with the evidence of one of the nurses and this was for a dialect in which there are few interpreters. The need for that interpreter was explained by the Procurator Fiscal depute when we had the hearing on submissions and I accept the explanation. I do not think it was in any way an attempt to prevent the witness giving evidence. He was clearly very nervous and he spoke with a pronounced stammer. I can understand why the Crown thought it appropriate to seek to make him more relaxed in order that he could give his evidence. The first attempt to get an interpreter was unsuccessful and we were unable to reconvene until 28 May. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>By this time three witnesses not on any lists were identified and traced and steps were taken to have them attend to give evidence. Thereafter we sat again on 26 and 27 August after which there was an adjournment to obtain the affidavit of Staff Nurse Pringle who had been on long term sick leave and was certified by her doctor as unfit to give evidence. Consideration was given as to how her evidence might be obtained as she, apparently, had a pivotal role in Ward 8 in the afternoon and evening of 26 December. She was unfit to give evidence on commission. After much discussion it was agreed that an affidavit could be obtained with all parties reserving their position about it being allowed. At that point, having agreed how a statement should be taken and an affidavit prepared, there was, apparently, a change of heart and another management meeting was convened on 23 September at the end of which an amended procedure for obtaining that statement was agreed. The Inquiry sat again on 26 October when, there being no disagreement that the affidavit should be admitted (subject to points to be made in submissions), I directed that it be read into the recording of the proceedings. We also heard from the Crown expert witness and concluded the Crown evidence.

I wish to make it clear that I thought that all the witnesses who gave evidence were endeavouring to do so to the best of their ability given the passage of time. I found them all to be generally credible and, for the most part, reliable. Where there was any doubt about reliability it tended to be because the witness could not remember something rather than because I thought that in some way he or she was being evasive or untruthful. Likewise there was some criticism in submission of the evidence from Rosemary and Mary Forrest. They were experiencing a traumatic time when, without any apparent reason or explanation, their mother-in-law's health deteriorated rapidly and dramatically over an afternoon and evening. I accept that they were doing their best to recall events as accurately as possible. Of course there were differences in recollection but I would expect nothing less four and a half years later.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:21.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

She was deemed to be medically unfit to attend court to give evidence or even to give evidence on commission. She did, however, sign an affidavit after a detailed statement had been obtained by the District Procurator Fiscal. I believe that in that affidavit she has tried her best to answer what was put to her to the best of her recollection. She was not, however, in court to give evidence. Her statement could not be challenged. It was obtained long after many witnesses had given evidence so her position could not be put to them. In some areas there were differences between her statement and evidence given by other witnesses. Where there is such a difference I have to prefer the evidence given in court. I say that not because I do not believe Mrs Pringle but simply because there has been no opportunity to challenge her version or to put her version to witnesses. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:21.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Mrs Mary McMillan Smith or Forrest was a lady of 85 years who had been active and reasonably self-sufficient for her years. For example, she did her own shopping and some gardening. She was at her son's house for Christmas Dinner on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>25 December 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> and her family became concerned at her apparent confusion and drowsiness.

She was seen there by Dr Dalakas who diagnosed low sodium and increasing confusion. He started her on a saline drip to increase her sodium levels.

She was seen here by, amongst others, Staff Nurse Albert Chinyamuchiko who helped to transfer her using a slide from a trolley to a bed.

Mrs Forrest said her mother-in-law could not walk unaided and had to be transferred by trolley and a slide to the bed. That was confirmed by Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko who helped slide her on to a bed. On the other hand the admission documents assessed her to be "independently mobile". As it transpired she was, in fact, "mobile" in so far as she was later walking around the ward. Rosemary Forrest left her believing she could still not walk unaided and she was still very confused. She had a canula in her arm to deliver the saline drip. The nurse who carried out any risk assessment, mobility or falls risk assessment did not give evidence so we will never know if the notes were accurately completed or on what basis any assessment was made.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:21.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Mary Mair said she was aware of three incidents before the fall and would have expected them to have been noted in the notes. They were not noted. In her view each was minor but the pattern was disturbing. As I have indicated, those who apparently told those conducting that investigation about the three incidents did not give evidence to this Inquiry.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Sometime after 13.30 hours it is noted that Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko did a set of observations on his return from break and noted that Mrs Forrest did not have a canula in situ. He said he asked Staff Nurse Pringle to refit it but this is not her memory. Her memory was that it was on a list for doctors. It is then noted in the Investigation that a nursing auxiliary found Mrs&nbsp;Forrest sitting on the floor between her bed and chair. She ascertained that she was all right and put her back on the chair. There was no direct evidence of that incident.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>At around 1400 hours Mrs Forrest having been wandering about the ward was at the nursing station having been asked to sit there for a while. Another nursing auxiliary is noted in the Investigation as confirming that Mrs Forrest was not sitting for long, was walking about each end of the ward regularly and into the doctor's room. She appeared confused and was brought back to sit down at the nursing station. The Investigation goes on to say that at about 1600 hours Staff Nurse Pringle found the patient sitting on the wrong bed. At about 1600 Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko took a further set of observations. Shortly afterwards at about 1620 Mrs Forrest was sitting on the floor by her bed having begun to slip off her chair. According to Doctor Hildebrand (who was there) she lowered her to the floor to save her slipping. No Incident Form was completed as a result of this (or any earlier) incident. On this occasion the staff nurse (Chinyamuchiko) thought an Incident Form might have been appropriate and that the doctor would complete it. The doctor did not share that view. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>At about 1650 a buzzer was heard and this attracted the attention of nursing staff. Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko heard the buzzer, looked and saw Mrs Forrest fall backwards. He shouted out to the other staff and ran to try and catch her but was unable to do so. She was lying on her back when he reached her. In evidence he said that he thought she may have hit her head on the floor but he could not be sure as he was trying to rush to her. He completed the Incident Form (production 2, page 3). He saw a marked difference in Mrs Forrest although no visible injuries. She was not talking and was, possibly, unconscious. The crash team was called and attended. It does appear that no-one in the crash team was told that Mrs Forrest may have hit her head. It is unlikely that either Dr Dalakas or Dr Chapman was told of any other fall, slip or trip and if they had been told that there had been three or four "falls" that might have meant upgrading the observation status from general to constant. As it was, general observation was maintained.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>After the crash or arrest team left, Mrs Forrest was moved to side room 4. Neurological observations had been instructed by the arrest team and the decision was taken not to perform a CT brain scan unless there was deterioration in consciousness level. That is significant when it comes to consider the evidence of the drop in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> and what was done about it.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is clear from the evidence that some neurological observations were taken but the sheet which records neurological observations is missing. There is little reference to such observations in the notes until Mrs Forrest was admitted to the MHDU. At the time of the ward round, which was between 1745 and 1800 hours, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> is noted as 12/15 and other observations were unremarkable. Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko spoke of starting to do neurological observations at about 1830 in the side room when another nurse, who turned out to be Staff Nurse Lesley Richards, arrived to assist. She had been sent from another ward by Brenda Cameron, nurse co-ordinator, after the arrest/crash call. She gave evidence that she completed the neurological observations and noted the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> of 6/15. She said she told Staff Nurse Pringle of this reduction in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> but then she was given a few other tasks to attend to and then went back to her own ward. Staff Nurse Pringle makes no mention of this in her affidavit but what is clear is that nothing was done by anyone as a result of this rapid deterioration in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>. Something should have been done. Dr Dalakas had instructed that doctors were to be told if there was any change. By any standard, and even allowing for confusion or drugs, the change from 12 to 6 in such a short time was significant and should have been conveyed to Dr Dalakas. That instruction having been given by the arrest team that a doctor was to be called if there was a fall in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>, it certainly was not done. Whether or not it would have changed the outcome is unlikely but steps might have been taken earlier to ascertain why the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> was so low and Mrs Forrest could have been made more comfortable. According to the family they could see she was in pain and had someone been told of the reduced </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> and spoken to the family, some pain relief may have been administered.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The family gave evidence that they thought that no neurological observations were done between about 1830 and the second crash call, but I can see no reason why Staff Nurse Richards should try to mislead the Inquiry and I am inclined to accept that she did carry out these observations. What the family did note however was a fairly marked and serious deterioration in Mrs Forrest's condition. They spoke of twitching or involuntary movements of the limbs and bulging and fixing of the eyes and her face swollen and distorted. There is no doubt that they expressed their concern on more than one occasion to nurses and probably also to at least one junior doctor. They spoke of a conversation with Staff Nurse Pringle. It seems likely that there were no further neurological observations taken between 1830 and the second arrest call which happened some time around or shortly after 2040 hours.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>At that stage Mrs Forrest was seen to be much less responsive and to have some facial twitching. A decision was made to transfer to the medical high dependency unit (MHDU) which was done. There is a note on page 14 of production 2 that a CT scan to the head was instructed at 0230 on 27 December. This disclosed the skull fracture and the haematoma. There was consultation with specialists at the Western General in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Edinburgh</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>. The injury was untreatable and the family was told that Mrs Forrest would die from that injury.

She could not rule out the fact that Mrs Forrest had had a heart attack and that may have caused her to fall. Equally the fall may have generated some heart activity. Likewise her low sodium may have caused her to fall. She may have had a slip or trip for another reason which caused her to fall. I believe it can be said, however, that her death <b>might</b> have been avoided had she not fallen. It is unsatisfactory that I cannot provide the family with an answer but the evidence is simply not there to allow me to interfere with the finding of the pathologist. The medical notes make no mention of any concern that Mrs Forrest had suffered any form of cardiac event while in the hospital.

The staff on duty should have knowledge of a patient's general whereabouts at all times, whether in or out of the ward. Patients on this level of observation are considered not to pose any serious risk of harm to themselves or others and are unlikely to leave the ward area. The next level is "constant" observation which is for patients considered to pose a significant risk to self or others. An allocated member of staff should be constantly aware at all times of the precise whereabouts of the patient through visual observation or hearing. The third level is "special" observation which is rarely prescribed and would involve a member of staff being at all times within sight and arms reach of a patient.

There are various guidelines within the policy but importantly the decision to increase the level of observation <i>"should be</i> <i>able to made by the senior nurse in charge of the unit on their own initiative". </i>It should be followed up by consultation with the appropriate medical staff as soon as possible. Staff are told to feel empowered to raise levels of observation. There was clear evidence of confusion amongst staff as to who could vary observation level. In this case Mrs Forrest arrived in the ward and her admission procedures were completed. She had to be transferred from a trolley to a bed by means of a slide. She was placed on general observation and she remained at that level throughout her stay in Ward 8. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Should the level of observation have been raised?

The lowest level was a general observation which applied to most patients. There was an increased level where greater observation of a patient was needed. Finally there was a level of one to one observation which was perhaps appropriate in such areas as high dependency or in certain mental health situations. Dr Davie thought there was no doubt that Mrs Forrest should have been on more constant observation than general. He made that assessment based on the fact that there had been two incidents before the fatal fall and the fact that Mrs Forrest was wandering. He felt these two previous "falls" should have been noted and that better observation might then have been done and the fatal fall avoided. As I have pointed out previously and will detail again shortly, the difficulty is that we cannot be sure whether or not there were previous "falls" or indeed slips, trips or wanderings and if there were, how many. It seems likely there were such incidents but we do not know from first hand evidence their nature, effect or consequence. During the course of cross-examination it came out that by two "falls" Dr Davie may have been referring to Mrs Forrest having been sitting on the ground and having been in the chair and been put to the ground by Dr Hildebrand as she was slipping off the chair. I am not however clear about this although he did have access to the internal Investigation Report.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dr Rhind said that with regard to Mrs Forrest, who had no drip, was wandering and had two or more "falls", he would have expected nurses to be more aware of what she was doing but it would not justify what he referred to as "special observation" which would tie up a nurse to do nothing else. That strikes me as meaning that she should have been on a level of observation higher than "general". However he then said that he might have increased observation to constant observation if there had been wandering in the corridor or if it had happened again, but that would only have achieved the prevention of the patient leaving the room and would not necessarily have prevented falling. In his view the confused patient would have been more confused on admission to the ward and the management plan for a drip was unachievable and that in itself increased risk. It was virtually impossible to keep a mobile patient in bed. While she was at risk of a fit or seizures that led to no different conclusion on observation as most hypo-nutrenic patients do not fit. Even having been seen by Dr Hildebrand teetering in the chair at 1620 did not change his view. It was common for patients to slip off chairs on to the floor. However, the fact that she was lowered to the floor should have been noted and communicated at handover. His other comments about any earlier falls were based to some extent on speculation as to the nature of the fall. He did not think the fatal fall was avoidable as nothing else could have been done unless someone was actually sitting with the patient. While confused and physically able, there was no way of confining Mrs Forrest to bed, especially if she did not understand why she was being made to stay in bed. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>That leads on to how many incidents had there been with Mrs Forrest. We have actual evidence of Mrs Forrest wandering about the ward and being taken to sit at the nurses' station for a while. Dr Hildebrand gave evidence of her teetering on the chair and being put to the floor for her own safety and then put back into the chair. We have evidence of the fatal fall. There is reference in the Investigation Report (production 8) and in hearsay evidence to other possible incidents. She may have been sitting at or on another patient's bed at one point. She may have had another slip from a chair. She may have been found wandering in a corridor. She may have been found on the floor in the ward or corridor. Unfortunately we have no hard evidence of any of these events. Some of them are recorded in the Investigation Report and it is likely therefore they occurred and information about them must have been given to the author of the report by a relevant witness or witnesses. However the witness or witnesses did not give evidence at this Inquiry. Other than saying that the incidents referred to in the Investigation Report in all probability happened, I can go little further and can make little comment on the number or nature of such incidents or any consequences following them. There is no record of them in the notes and if they happened there probably should be. Indeed, Mrs Mair said as much in evidence. The fact that information about these incidents was given to the internal investigation means that somebody knew about them and that they should have been in the notes. There is nothing in the notes. We do not know who should have generated a note. The lack of information in the notes and the lack of communication to Dr Dalakas and Dr Chapman about any earlier "falls" meant that the examination at the first arrest call was carried out on incomplete information. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>What can be taken from the Investigation Report is that certain members of staff told the author of the report that they were aware of incidents.

The Crown submitted that although the observation policy may have existed staff were not aware of it and even now, when the policy is an actual document, staff were still not aware of the content and there was no obligation to attend training. The family were even more scathing about the observation policy and I do not intend to detail their criticisms. They do, however, highlight the fact that Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko said in evidence that he was unaware of an observation policy when he was on duty on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>26 December 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>. He also said that constant observation would have been appropriate "probably". Various witnesses said that nurses would have been continually assessing patients on the ward. That may be so but how much continual assessment could be done when it was a busy ward, a "horrendous shift", one nurse short and, for a period, one further auxiliary short? The unfortunate thing is that we did not have hard evidence of what happened to Mrs Forrest during the three hours or so between 1330 and 1640. If she had a number of incidents (as suggested in the Investigation Report) and they were known to nursing staff then that should have acted as a trigger to alert them that this was a woman who was a risk to herself if she wandered around and therefore a closer eye needed to be kept on her. However, given the business of the ward and the staff level that was not something which could have been easily achieved.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Further, indicative of the state of knowledge of nurses about the observation policy, Staff Nurse Pringle comments in her statement which forms part of her affidavit that <i>"If you have somebody coming into the ward and just lying on their bed then they are generally observed in terms of the general policy. The constant level of observation is basically an allocated member of staff and they should be in visual or hearing sight. In hindsight somebody like Mrs Forrest should have been under the constant level of observation. Basically, if a patient became a threat to themselves then I would phone the nursing co-ordinator and ask for someone to be put on obs in terms of the policy. Mrs Forrest should have been</i> <i>on constant observation."</i> Staff Nurse Pringle could not be questioned on what she meant by that but it illustrates yet another interpretation of how the observation policy worked. Some witnesses thought it was a decision made by doctors, some thought a senior nurse could make and here it was thought there was a role for the nursing co-ordinator.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>In the submission for NHS Fife it is suggested that the view of Dr Rhind on observation should be considered the correct view.

Against that sort of background can an observation policy ever be anything more than an aspiration in the overall plan to keep a patient safe?</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>If it was to be accepted that there had been the various incidents before the fatal fall then there is little doubt steps should have been taken to increase observation to reduce the risk of further incidents or falls. As I have said repeatedly we were not privy to evidence of such incidents so I cannot make a formal finding about observations standing all the evidence we did hear. Dr Davie's evidence was what the ward should have aspired to and made perfect sense. However, on the day, even if someone had decided to increase observation levels, it was unlikely anything could have been done in time to prevent the fatal fall.

It is however an important issue and may bear some repetition if only to provide emphasis. As already stated it was known before the commencement of the shift that there would be one staff nurse not coming in and Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko volunteered to do a second shift. That meant that the late shift comprised Staff Nurses Pringle and Chinyamuchiko and two auxiliary nurses. That was one qualified nurse short of their normal compliment.

There was a patient who was dying and who died later in the afternoon. Staff Nurse Pringle was sufficiently concerned about the level of cover that she contacted the co-ordinator and I shall deal with this later. I reject completely any suggestion that the ward was not particularly busy. It may not have been full but there was a lot happening. It was described in evidence as "a horrendous shift".

He said that patients fall from time to time and little can be done to prevent it. That may well be a fact but it does not make it either right or acceptable. Common sense again suggests that where there is hard evidence of somebody wandering or being found on the floor, there might be a susceptibility to a fall, slip or trip and a note, even a mental note, might be made of it. This was a patient who should have been getting a saline drip through a canula in her hand. She had low sodium. The drip was to try to rectify that. She was therefore not receiving her prescribed treatment. There is no evidence that anyone did anything about that between her admission and the first arrest call.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dr Rhind said that implementing a drip for a confused and mobile patient who was wandering was well nigh impossible and that stands to reason.

I would also state that there was never any justification for the level of observation reaching special. There was probably enough to have justified an increase in the formal level of observation to "constant" but, possibly because everyone was otherwise so busy, it was not considered. There was also some confusion or ignorance about exactly who could make the decision to increase observation level. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I accept the evidence of Dr Rhind that it is not desirable to, effectively, restrain someone in bed. Mrs Forrest was confused but mobile even if the family thought that she may have been unsteady on her feet. There was little which could be done to prevent her wandering around the ward. If she was going to have a fall, slip or trip, then to prevent it someone would have had to have been within arms reach of her the whole time and that was simply neither achievable nor practical. The "fatal fall" was witnessed by Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko who must have been relatively close by as he dashed to her as he saw her fall. His impression was that she had hit her head on the floor but reviewing all his evidence I wonder if that impression came from hindsight. He did not seem to say so at the time and there was no indication to the arrest or crash team that there had been any potential head injury. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Even if at some point in the afternoon a decision had been taken by someone that Mrs Forrest merited a higher level of observation, it would have taken some time to implement that decision. Consideration would require to be given to the implications for the rest of the ward (Dr Chapman). Would extra staff be needed and if so where would they come from? How long would it take to get such extra staff? Would ward working require to be re-organised to cope with the increased observation necessary? None of that could have been done in minutes or perhaps even an hour or two and, particularly, could not have been done on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>26 December 2005</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> within a short time. Staff Nurse Pringle had already tried to get an extra member of staff and, one way or another, had either abandoned the attempt or failed. Therefore, even if she had been told about all these incidents and had made a decision to increase the observation level, she would have known from about 1500 hours after she had spoken to Brenda Cameron that nothing could be done about extra staff unless she contacted the co-ordinator again to try to persuade her to go out for agency or bank staff. To achieve all that could have taken several hours by which time, sadly, it was already too late. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>While I have reached the conclusion therefore that on the information available there might have been justification to increase the observation level and certainly commonsense suggested that it should be increased, even if it had been done it is highly unlikely that anyone would have been in place at the time the fatal fall occurred. Accordingly any failure to increase observation level is not likely to have prevented the fatal fall. Closer observation in the general sense might have meant that someone would have been paying closer attention to where she was and what she was doing but I have to bear in mind that Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko saw the fall and rushed to try to catch her so he was relatively close by. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The issue was raised about whether family members could be used to help keep an eye on patients.

The role played by the co-ordinating charge nurse has, since this incident, changed quite considerably and it has to be said that the change is for the better although I am still not certain about the amount or quality of training for that role. That seems to derive from experience on the job. That in itself led to Staff Nurses Cameron and Pringle having different interpretations of the role.

If a ward was short of nursing staff the nurse in charge of the ward would contact the co-ordinating charge nurse to see if further staff might be available. To find further staff the co-ordinating charge nurse should, according to management, in the first place, trawl the other wards in the hospital to see if there was any excess capacity, and thereafter try to get a bank nurse or finally an agency nurse. Staff Nurse Cameron was in some doubt about the requirement to trawl the hospital and felt she perhaps should only trawl the medical wards where the shortage was in a medical ward. That was clearly not the case and it raises an issue of training. If someone in the role has learned that was the way to operate then in the absence of any written guidelines or formal training his or her understanding will never change. If he or she then mentors someone training for the role, any misunderstanding will be passed on. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>In this case Staff Nurse Pringle contacted Staff Nurse Cameron and there was a discussion about the fact that someone had not turned up for work and Ward 8 was short and busy. Mary Mair described the shift on Ward 8 that day as being "horrendous" and that same expression is used by Staff Nurse Pringle in her statement. While I accept it was not a full ward, I reject the contention of NHS that it was "far from full". There appeared to have been twenty beds occupied out of twenty five, it was admitting and there were patients who were demanding considerable attention. The nature of admission to hospital has also changed since this incident and that appears to be a change for the better. The date, 26 December, may not be insignificant as it is part of the Christmas holiday. There is a difference of recollection between Staff Nurses Cameron and Pringle over the terms of their discussion, but, regardless of which version is accepted, the upshot was that there was to be no additional help for Ward 8. There is no evidence to suggest that the co-ordinating charge nurse was under any pressure not to go out to bank or agency nurses. If that was the only option available it could have been done but clearly it might have taken have taken several hours to get such a nurse into place even if he or she was available on 26 December. There is no evidence to indicate the availability or otherwise of such nurses. Staff Nurse Cameron in fact gave evidence to the effect that Ward 8 was not scheduled to have a bank nurse on that shift. That suggests that there had been no expectation that a regular staff member might be off and there was no earlier request for a bank or agency nurse. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Unfortunately we are without the evidence of the staff nurse in charge of the earlier shift who appears to have been David Cation and we therefore do not know what he knew or did not know or what he did or did not do in relation to any perceived shortage for the later shift, except that someone asked Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko to work a double shift which he agreed to do. That would seem to suggest that earlier in the day there was some knowledge that there was likely to be a shortage in Ward 8 during the late shift. Even with that they were still one nurse short.

It arose from experience. That seems to have been borne out by other witnesses. That on its own has clearly led to a misunderstanding of what she may or may not have been entitled to do throughout the hospital to try to get assistance to Ward 8. I would stress that is not a criticism on Staff Nurse Cameron. She was presented with the Investigation Report which makes criticism of her conduct in the role on the day. She had not seen this before and she was, quite rightly, incensed at these criticisms without having being given the opportunity to comment. It shone through loud and clear from the expert evidence that if an investigation into an incident is to have any effect at all the results of that investigation must be disseminated amongst all those who were involved and discussed with relevant parties. The failure to inform Staff Nurse Cameron of the conclusions, as far as she was concerned, raises the question of who exactly the management has discussed the conclusions of the investigation with. It lends some credence to the suggestion that regardless of what management says is its policy to educate staff on policy and procedures, it may not always happen in practice. There was evidence, as I have said, about certain medical and nursing staff not being aware of certain policies despite management evidence that should not happen.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>On the basis of the evidence heard there is no basis for concluding that the co-ordinating charge nurse was difficult or obstructive or unsupportive in this particular case. This area is one which has been addressed by NHS Fife and it is to be hoped that lessons have been learned about training for the role so that there is a full understanding amongst all parties of what is required of a co-ordinating charge nurse. The improvements to an increased use of bank nursing with a reduction in agency nursing should also be of assistance in filling emergency staffing requirements. The removal of bed management from the role will also help. For the avoidance of any doubt in the future there ought to be specific training for the role of coordinating charge nurse. I understand that at all times when there is no responsible manager on site there is a duty manager on call. It is not clear in what circumstances such a duty manager would need to be involved in staffing issues and once again that is something which needs to clarified and specified to remove any doubt.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Provision of intravenous fluids.</span></u></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>On her presentation at A&amp;E and on examination by Dr Dalakas there, there was a preliminary diagnosis that low sodium was causing Mrs Forrest's problems. She was to be put on to an intravenous saline drip and the appropriate canula was inserted to allow this to happen. There is evidence that when she arrived at Ward 8 and was put on to a bed from the trolley by means of a slide she was still attached to a drip. By 1330 when Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko was doing a set of observations he saw that she had pulled out her canula. He said that he told Staff Nurse Pringle who appeared to him to have been aware of it. Her position is different and she thought that he had put this on a list of tasks for doctors. Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko was not trained to replace it and he presumed it would be done. It is not clear when, if ever, it was replaced but what is certain was that up until the "fatal fall" she was never reconnected to an intravenous drip. It is also not clear from the charts how much, if any, of the fluid she actually received. The completion of the chart is unsatisfactory since part of it is scored out which was interpreted in different ways by different witnesses. I think it is fair to say that no witness could say with any certainty how much fluid had been given nor why there was no attempt made to deliver the prescribed fluids. The manner of completion of the fluid chart remains unexplained. That, in my view, is a significant defect in the system of working. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The question arises as to whether the lack of intravenous fluid had any effect on the outcome. It appears from Dr Rhind that in the absence of an intravenous fluid drip another means of treating low sodium is to reduce fluid intake. While that was never formally stated as being the alternate treatment, by default that is what has happened. There is no record of any alternative treatment being prescribed and no record of what fluids, if any, were taken. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It stands to reason that a patient who is wandering around is unlikely to be fitted to a fluid drip. A confused patient is even more unlikely to tolerate the fluid insertion. The fact remains however that intravenous fluid was the prescribed treatment by Dr Dalakas. By 1330 at the latest it was not being administered and that fact was known to nursing staff. It does not appear to have been conveyed to medical staff who would only become aware of it at the crash or arrest call following the "fatal fall". Otherwise it would have become known at the ward round. I agree with Dr Rhind that it would not be appropriate to try to keep someone like Mrs Forrest restrained in any way in order to ensure administration of treatment. Whether or not it would have made a difference there does seem to be a failure of communication for three to four hours in telling medical staff that the prescribed treatment was not being applied. No consideration seems to have been given by anyone to the fact that the prescribed treatment was not being administered. The fluid charts on the notes are in an unsatisfactory state. Entries are scored out and changed. There were differing views on what that meant and that is a concern. I understand that scoring out should not happen. If it does happen then there is doubt about what it means. Is it that the fluid has been administered? Is it that the prescription has been cancelled? That doubt should not arise. That it does arise highlights another training issue for nursing staff in particular.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>However, in the absence of expert nursing evidence there is little that can be concluded.

It does seem that if, having removed the canula, fluids were reduced that could have been an alternative treatment for low sodium. But there is no suggestion in the notes that was considered and therefore if it happened it happened by chance or default. We do not know whether or not any fluids were in fact taken.

I have commented above about the fluid charts. As with many medical notes some of them are actually quite difficult to read and interpret. One of the main failings in this case is the fact that neurological observations having been instructed following the first crash call, the record of any such observations is missing. There was evidence from Staff Nurse Richards that the neurological observations were on a separate clip from the main nursing notes. She said that she completed them and left the clip board at the bottom of the bed. The family said that they did not think that any neurological observations had been done after 1800hrs. Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko said that he started doing a set and that Staff Nurse Richards came into the room and took over. She confirmed that she did this. I tend to accept that. Neither of these people had any reason to lie or mislead. The family was in a very stressful situation which had moved very quickly from Mrs Forrest simply being a bit drowsy and confused to being bed bound and semi-conscious at best following an unexplained fall. It is no surprise that there were different accounts of what went on in the side room at about 1830 hrs. There was also evidence that the notes would eventually be married together. Somewhere, somehow these neurological observation notes have gone missing. Given that there were different expectations and understandings of the frequency of neurological observations and given the importance of a reduction in </span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>GCS</span><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'> to doctors' views on matters, the absence of the notes is important. No-one knows what has happened to them so it is difficult to make any recommendation or suggestion except that there might be less chance of loss of notes if they are all kept together rather than kept separately. I trust this is one aspect that will be considered by NHS Fife in its documentation review.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>There are other minor criticisms of the documentation. As presented in production 2 (and I accept that this is an excerpt from the full notes) there is no great logical order or sequence and they were at times difficult to follow. The separation of medical and nursing notes, no cross referencing to notes for fluids, observations etc makes them difficult for the lay person and must make it time consuming for a doctor or nurse. There are pages which are headed up with the wrong name for Mrs Forrest and that is regrettable. That is, I think, simply carelessness rather than confusion of one person's notes with another. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>However, to go much beyond what I have said about documentation is difficult. The medical experts made some comment on certain aspects of it and I did not take their comments to be generally critical other than some of the areas I have mentioned. The difficulty arises in respect that many of the notes were made by nurses. Two important nurses did not give evidence one of whom has produced an affidavit and statement. That itself is of limited value. There was no nursing expert to comment on either the state of the notes or the evidence of the nurses as it emerged.

Unfortunately the nurse who completed the admission notes to ward 8 did not give evidence so we do not know on what basis he assessed as he did. What we do know is that having been transferred from a trolley to a bed by means of a slide, while in the ward, Mrs Forrest was mobile. There is evidence of her wandering around and being asked to take a seat at the nurses' station. There is also evidence that she was, at best, unsteady on her feet which would tend to tie in with the need to transfer using a slide. The sort of assessment done here for mobility or falls risk is objective. There are some guidelines laid out for completion of the assessments but even there anomalies arose and without either the author of the assessments or a nursing expert it is not possible to comment further.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>As part of the review of procedures carried out following this incident, hospitals in Fife now use the Fife Early Warning System (FEWS) which is a standardised form of documenting and recording general medical observations. This seems to be a major step forward and is a much more consistent means of recording information. It has the advantage that both doctors and nursing staff are using the same criteria and there is positive guidance on what should happen in specific circumstances. The question of training in its use remains a live issue. The new tools used to assess such matters as mobility are also a step forward provided there is proper and adequate training. Witnesses from NHS Fife spoke to all this but there was no independent nursing comment. It does appear from the evidence of some of the doctors, including Doctors Davie and Rhind, that the FEWS system is a significant improvement on what was in place before and is an acceptable and approved means of assessment.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Training.</span></u></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I have commented briefly on the question of training of co-ordinating charge nurses. The whole issue of training is, strictly, not something relevant to this inquiry, but it has been raised by NHS Fife who were at pains to point out what they were doing to educate staff and what was involved in the professional development of staff. The changes are encouraging and welcome. The application of national initiatives in standards in relation to the training of medical and nursing staff is welcome. There remains a lingering doubt, however, that all policies, etc are properly communicated to staff and in turn that the staff are trained on them. I have commented earlier on the observation policy and the evidence of knowledge or lack of knowledge of it. It is not clear if the new observation policy has been disseminated wider or better or whether or not there is a greater awareness of it. The existence of a document was not universally known. There is also a hint or suggestion that certain aspects like falls risk assessment are "a matter for nurses" and that doctors need to have no part in it. There is also a suggestion that there was a misconception about who could change observation status. It is important that <b>all </b>staff are aware of <b>all</b> policies which have a bearing on the treatment, health or safety of patients. If these policies are contained in documents, while it might be impractical to make sure that all staff actually have copies of documents, they should certainly be aware that the documents exist, where these documents are kept and they should be readily accessible. There should be some means of ensuring that staff have actually read and understood them. There should be training in important policies and some documented means of ascertaining that any individual is aware of the policy concerned. If something is truly a matter for nurses or doctors then it should say so but all staff need to know what the policy is regardless of who may be responsible for implementation. Such training should be compulsory and subject to audit.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I was concerned that not all training is compulsory. Mrs Owens spoke about all that was being done to improve the delivery of health services in the hospitals in Fife and I accept that many steps have been taken and progress has been made. The Practice and Professional Development Unit (PPDU) is a team of nurses set up to ensure nursing practice is up to date, is the best practice and to issue Compulsory Professional Development (CPD) guidelines. There was now a random audit of patient records using an audit tool. As many as five records a week would be audited. There was some training in record keeping addressed through standards and initiatives like "Getting It Right". There is an attempt to standardise documentation and reduce duplication all with the object of improving care and demonstrating that improvement. There is ongoing work in the electronic keeping of patients' records. A documentation summit involving 100 charge nurses reviewed documents to avoid duplication and to decide what was wanted from unified records.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The FEWS system is now in use and that is the same as or similar to the systems used in many other health boards. The chart was colour coded and there was guidance that if the score was, or remained, high then there should be a reference to medical staff. Five such charts were audited weekly. Nationally, Fife was said to be the most improved in this area.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Training issues for individuals can be identified in their personal development plans or can be raised by a charge nurse. Some training is advertised and staff can apply to attend. There is some compulsory training in areas like handling and hygiene. There are refresher courses. However, there is no compulsion to attend "Getting It Right" and no compulsory training on documentation. There is some targeted training where staff would be made to go and there is also formal and informal training at ward level where the charge nurse feeds down appropriate information on specified topics.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Given the importance of matters such as documentation which seems to be recognised by the increased regime of auditing, I find it hard to believe that there is no compulsion to attend training on "Getting It Right" or documentation. While I accept that there are many other changes both implemented and in contemplation, I find it hard to accept that there should not be much more emphasis on compulsory training. I referred earlier to the poor state of the fluid charts. That highlights the need for training. As a further example, three witnesses gave evidence in person or affidavit about the role of the coordinating charge nurse. All three had a slightly different view. The role has now changed but, as I understood the evidence, there is still no formal training for the role and that the nurse learns for his or her own experience and that of others. The risk there is that any misinterpretation of the role will perpetuate. The criticism in the internal investigation of Staff Nurse Cameron in her role as coordinating charge nurse and the failure to convey that criticism to her along with her non-acceptance of it highlights the need, in my view, for compulsory training for that role. The fact that she became aware for the first time when she was giving evidence that she had been subject to criticism indicates that management thought that they had identified a fault yet did nothing to train the person criticised. It is all very well to say that any issues with an individual nurse can be dealt with as part of the personal development plan and it is all very well to seek to standardise documentation but without compulsory training in crucial areas how can consistent standards be achieved and what sanction might there be for someone who declines to voluntarily train? The fact that Staff nurse Cameron had not had this issue dealt with as part of her personal development plan speaks volumes. It is also important that all staff nurses, whether likely to act as co-ordinators or not, are fully trained on what the role of the co-ordinator involves. There should be no room for doubt.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal

style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Again the issue of communication is one which is only of passing relevance to the Inquiry and my comments on it are  hampered by the lack of expert nursing evidence. However, it is clear from the evidence that there were various failures in communication along the line. Bearing in mind that this was a lady who on admission required to be moved by a slide from a trolley to a bed, a number of issues are raised. What was communicated, by whom and to whom, in relation to the various incidents of falls, slips or trips before the incident involving Dr Hildebrand remains unclear. The accident/Investigation Reports make it quite clear that auxiliary nurses had some knowledge but the Inquiry has not heard from these auxiliary nurses. Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko had some knowledge of some incidents. It is not clear what knowledge, if any, Staff Nurse Pringle had of any incidents. She says she had none. There is nothing noted. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>If these things happened then certain if not all of them of them were noteworthy and should have been entered into the notes. That was certainly the expectation of Mary Mair. Being returned to the ward by a porter, if it happened, should have been noted and acted upon especially if this happened after earlier wandering events or after nurses were alerted to her wandering and asked her to sit at the nurses station. If she was returned by a porter who had found her on the floor, regardless of how she got there, that should have been noted. There is, in my view, significant failure here; either the failure to present evidence before the Inquiry or, if we accept the content of the Investigation Report, a failure to note the various incidents and communicate any of them to medical staff. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is clear from the evidence that the medical staff were not told of any earlier incidents. Dr Chapman was of the view that if she was aware of earlier incidents that might have changed her view on observation status. Nor were the doctors told that Mrs Forrest may have hit her head on the floor at the time of the fatal fall. That is maybe because, as I have said, I think that Staff Nurse Chinyamuchiko may be recalling that with the benefit of hindsight. The doctors did however seem to carry out a full examination including an examination of the head and found no evidence of injury. Dr Dalakas said that he instructed neurological observations. There was differing evidence as to the frequency of such observations. What did come through, however, was that the instructions were, apparently, not fully implemented. The absence of the appropriate chart is crucial. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is difficult therefore to be more critical of communication in the absence of expert comment. Emphasis was given time and again throughout the evidence to the necessity of a team approach and such an approach should involve free, open and frank exchanges between medical and nursing staff so that the fullest possible picture is obtained in relation to any patient. That does not seem to have operated well, if at all, in December 2005. Once again steps seem to have been taken by NHS Fife to try to encourage greater and better communication. However, parts of the evidence still contained the flavour that certain things were matters for nurses or matters for doctors and I have to wonder if despite the great aspiration to more communication and openness there still exists some demarcation between doctors on the one hand and nurses on the other. That is simply a suspicion and I would encourage NHS Fife in its aspiration and hope that doctors and nurses will actively contribute to making it work. None of it will work without proper training and I make no apology for raising that again. There are clear areas where the training of nursing and medical staff should be uniform and that training should be compulsory for doctors and nurses.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Should a CT scan have been taken earlier</span></u></b><b><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>?</span></b></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>If I accept the evidence of the various doctors then the answer is no.

It was produced at a time when the internal investigation was not complete. The family would have liked to have seen more or at least a follow-up on completion.

The whole system of admission of patients has changed with the creation of a Medical Admissions Unit. This mirrors what happens across much of Scotland and seems, by all accounts, to be the accepted standard. All medical admissions are taken to the unit and, once assessed, sent to the appropriate specialist area. There are many more nurses employed across the medical directorate. Where additional staff went to a specific area, that had the effect of reducing absence, sick leave and use of bank nurses. The bank of nurses is now part of the establishment and there are now 1,000 staff on the bank. There is also a tool used to assess adequate, over or under staffing. Since June 2007 a Clinical Co-ordinator has replaced the duty charge nurse. They are all charge nurses or senior charge nurses but there is still no formal training. They rely on experience. I have commented on that earlier. Falls risk assessment is done using a new tool whereby, on admission, a patient is given a score which is part of the record and admission documentation. There is also training for nurses on wards. Work is ongoing in other areas such as reviewing observation policy. The medical directorate team "walk the floor" every morning to make sure that there are no major problems and that there is, for example, adequate nursing cover. These are positive steps but I repeat my reservations about training.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Bearing all this in mind and allowing for the fact that whatever I determine must derive from evidence and not conjecture or speculation, where does which take us? </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Section 6 (1) (a) - Where and when the death and any accident resulting in death took place.</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Mrs Forrest, who was born on 1 January 1920, died at 0120 hrs on 29 December 2005 within Queen Margaret Hospital, </span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Dunfermline</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>.</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The accident which contributed to her death happened at 1650 hrs on 26 December 2005 in ward 8 of Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline.</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Section 6 (1) (b) - The cause or causes of such death and any accident resulting in the death.</span></i></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The Procurator Fiscal depute in her submission invited the court to partially accept the findings of the post mortem report (production 3) but suggested that the cause of death should be amended to read "1(a) Cranial Cerebral Injuries and 1(b) Atherosclerotic Coronary Heart Disease."

Both the physicians were of the view that the primary cause of death was the brain injury sustained during the fall. I can readily understand why they came to that view and they cannot be criticised for it. Without the benefit of a post mortem examination that must have been the obvious cause of death to Dr Chapman. Given the cause of death was an issue and that she was the treating consultant, it is perhaps surprising that her first sight of the death certificate/post mortem report was in the witness box. Had she been advised at the time she would have had an opportunity to comment if she felt it may have been mistaken in its conclusion. Dr Davie gave a view based on the documentation presented to him and as a result of questions during his evidence. He suggested that the pathologist received inaccurate information to the effect that Mrs Forrest had had a heart attack. That proposition was not supported in evidence and the suggestion was not put to the pathologist in her evidence. He did concede that he would normally defer to a pathologist and his conclusion was based on him not finding evidence of a coronary incident prior to death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>From the post mortem report there was ample evidence that Mrs Forrest had coronary artery disease. There had been previous heart surgery. Her medication included treatment for high blood pressure. While it may seem obvious to the layman that it was the injury from the fall which killed her, the conclusions reached in an Inquiry such as this require to be evidence based. I could speculate that if two physicians were prepared to disagree with the pathologist then another pathologist may also have reached a different conclusion. It would be difficult to see any pathologist ignoring the condition of the heart when considering the cause of death. Therefore, in the absence of any contrary expert evidence, the cause of death certified by Dr Brooks Lim must remain. It is important to note that no one ever suggested that she had reached any wrong conclusion.

Mrs Forrest was noted by Dr Dalakas as being unsteady on her feet, but many patients are unsteady (Dr Rhind).

The neurological observation chart should not have been lost. Training was also irrelevant as was communication. Issues relating to care following the fall were not relevant.

The hospital itself recognised that there had been certain failings and set up an action plan to remedy these faults. There have been other local and national initiatives which have also addressed matters raised in this Inquiry. It is important to highlight what has been done and what continues to be done.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I have made mention of the closing of ward 8 as it was in December 2005 and the creation of the Acute Medical Admissions Unit into which all medical admissions are put to be assessed with a view to receiving the appropriate treatment. There is attention to skill mix and more staff on that ward. From the evidence of Drs Davie and Rhind such a unit seems to be what is operated in many hospitals across the country and is what might be termed the "industry standard". That is without doubt a positive step.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is also encouraging to know of the changes made in relation to staff. The new AMAU has seen an additional 9 full time equivalent nurses and there has been a review of the skill mix. In addition, further nurses have been or are being recruited. This has had an effect on absence levels and has seen a reduction in complaints and in the use of bank staff. The bank itself is larger and is now part of the establishment. Accessibility to the bank has improved especially at weekends and on holidays. The fact that bank nurses are part of the establishment means they are subject to CPD and training. According to Mrs Owens the result is that the chances of a ward getting the staff it needs is now 98%.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Another change has seen wards having a senior charge nurse and a charge nurse who each try to work opposite shifts to ensure a senior person is on duty during the whole of daytime shifts. The AMAU has more senior staff. At weekends there is a charge nurse on duty within each ward. A duty charge nurse is available on public holidays. The duty charge nurse can now telephone the nurse manager at home for advice or support and there are identified on call managers. There is a new regime for medical cover in the hospital at night. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The role of the charge nurse co-ordinator has changed. S/he no longer manages beds and his/her only role is in the deployment of staff and estate and pharmaceutical requirements. Bed co-ordinators deal only with beds. There remains the issue of training of co-ordinators. The evidence from various witnesses was that coordinating charge nurses were experienced and senior charge nurses and, when they start to do the job, they are aware what is involved. There is some shadowing and they receive information about what is expected in the role. Mrs Owens said that the job did not lend itself to classroom style training. In 2005 there was training covering policies and procedures and a folder containing information showing the standard preferred ward staffing levels. Now there are guidelines and a "purple folder" with information on how to go about getting additional staff, bank nurse numbers, incident reporting and other matters. This has all been updated since 2005. The removal of bed management has helped the role. A nurse manager also walks round the hospital every day to check for issues and action them.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It has to be said that these are all changes for the better but unless and until training is uniform and compulsory there has to be a chance that misunderstandings will persist. If learning the job is done by mentoring then such misunderstandings are likely to be inherited by those learning. A written specification of the role and formal, obligatory training should be considered for all those who are currently undertaking or those who will undertake the role of nurse co-ordinator.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Patient safety is something which has attracted a national programme with the aim of reducing harm to patients as much as possible. Medical staff are involved which is good. However, according to Mrs Owens, staff are kept aware of developments by means of a notice board on each ward. That lays the onus on individual staff members to read the notice board. Patient safety is one of the major issues in any hospital. Is it enough to update staff by such notices or should there be a more formal system of information provision with some sort of audit check to ensure that staff are keeping up to date? In my view training on patient safety should be more proactive and rigorous.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The hospital recognised weaknesses in documentation and, in fairness, seems to have done something to address some of the issues. There was evidence that documentation had improved but I have seen no up to date documentation with which to draw comparisons. The auditing of records certainly seems to be more frequent and more robust. Some staff nurse time is allowed for audit purposes and there can also be spot and random checks. Inadequacies are drawn to the attention of relevant staff and failures could lead to disciplinary action. There is training for nurses in documentation and much more communication about issues in documentation. Study days and record keeping training is held. There is a national initiative on Clinical Quality Indicators and that includes issues such as falls prevention and nutrition. A unified record is being worked on with a view to all health care professionals using a single document for a patient. Electronic records are under development. There have been changes to FEWS charts based on lessons learned in this and other cases.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>All of this is to be commended but it will be at its most effective only if staff training is obligatory.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>According to witnesses, risk assessment documents have been developed and improved. In 2006 falls awareness training was introduced and a new risk assessment tool was put in place with training for staff nurses. It is difficult to comment on the question of risk assessment in this case as we did not have evidence form the person who carried out the assessment. Clearly any initiative designed to reduce the risk and instance of slips and trips is to be welcomed. Again, however, the effectiveness will depend on training.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Communication in some areas has improved. The fact that a nurse manager walks the floor daily gives an opportunity for ward staff to have contact with senior staff, something they did not have in the past. Situation Background Assessment and Recommendation (SBAR) is a new tool introduced to assist verbal communication and written records. By applying a consistent standard it should make the handover at shifts more thorough. It is used by nurses in writing notes which ought to make records clearer. It should also make for much more consistency. A patient safety briefing two or three times a day brings members of the ward team together to discuss issues. That is another opportunity for communication. Mrs Owens holds a quarterly meeting with charge nurses and the Chief Executive has joined these meetings. She also said she issues a weekly "Twitter" mail although I have reservations about the effectiveness of such a means of communication and trust that it would not be used as the only means of communication for matters which might be seen as important.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>The family was particularly critical of complaints handling and, it has to be said, with some justification. The hospital seems to have accepted that its complaints handling system was not as good as it might have been and taken steps to improve them. Within "normal" working hours there is a manager on site to deal with complaints as they arise. Ward staff are now better trained and equipped to handle complaints. If support is needed out of hours contact can be made with a senior nurse manager or directorate manager and a person at that level is on hand on public holidays. At the monthly meeting with nurse managers complaints now form a part of the agenda.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>It is important to recognise that both Dr Davie and Dr Rhind said that what was being done was positive and moving in the right direction. As it is now so long since Mrs Forrest died and steps have been taken in many areas where there could have been criticism there is little to be achieved by making suggestions simply because the matter has arisen in the evidence. Partly due to the passage of time, partly due to the expert evidence I did hear and partly due to the lack of certain expert evidence I do not feel that it is appropriate to make any recommendation which might lead to disciplinary action being taken against any individual member of staff. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>I should comment on one or two of the points made in the family's submission. They suggest that Staff Nurse Pringle may have given someone else's medication to Mrs Forrest and this may have resulted in the sudden change in her demeanour. I have re-read Nurse Pringle's statement and that part of it is open to different interpretations. Unfortunately we have not been able to clarify it. It does say "when I was giving her the medication" but there is no medication referred to in the notes, she was at the wrong bed so can we be sure who the "her" referred to? She then goes on to say she took Mrs Forrest to her own bed and told her to wait while she (Nurse Pringle) got the medicine. There is no further reference to medicine. It cannot therefore be said with any certainty at all that Mrs Forrest was given any medicine never mind wrong medicine.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>On page 16 of their submission they list a number of suggested failures in meeting clinical care and for completeness I will comment briefly on these.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='line-height:150%'>Failure to maintain dignity.
