He noted her history, that she had been vomiting over 24 hours but with no diarrhoea. He found that her pulse and temperature were normal. Her abdomen was soft but with some tenderness over the upper abdomen. Her bowel sounds were normal. His diagnosis was that she was suffering from a viral gastro-intestinal infection. He recommended home treatment by taking fluids and resting.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>4.

At the Glasgow Emergency Medical Services, Kirsty was examined by Dr. Barratt. Her blood pressure, temperature and pulse were within normal limits. Dr. Barratt noted her history of vomiting fluids during the day but with no diarrhoea. She had vomited foodstuffs initially, but was now producing "coffee ground" vomit. She was complaining of abdominal pain. On examination Dr. Barratt noted that Kirsty appeared well hydrated. Her abdomen was tender generally with guarding or tensing of the muscles over the upper right abdomen. Dr. Barratt's diagnosis was haematemesis.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>6. In the course of her examination by Dr. Barratt, Kirsty again vomited and the vomit contained "coffee ground" blood. Dr.Barratt arranged for her immediate transfer to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Victoria Infirmary.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>7.

She was examined by Dr. Orr, who was the on-call Senior House Officer for Medical Patients. Dr. Orr noted the history of Kirsty's referral from Dr. Barratt, that Kirsty was suffering abdominal pain and haematemesis. She had suffered from 36 hours of bilious green vomiting and then had developed brown vomit. He noted that Dr. Barratt had been adamant that this was "coffee ground" vomit. Kirsty was also complaining of abdominal pain, especially in the left upper quadrant of the epigastrium. She was otherwise well and had previously been well.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>8. On taking her history Dr. Orr noted that Kirsty had first started her monthly periods the previous month. He noted that she was not passing flatus. On examining Kirsty Dr. Orr recorded her pulse rate at 90. Her blood pressure was normal and she was apyrexial. He observed that she looked well. He found her upper abdomen to be tender but he detected no rebound. He recorded "slight peritonism". The per rectal examination was normal. He concluded that Kirsty had suffered a Mallory- Weiss tear of the oesophagus occurring against a background of gastroenteritis. He proposed that she be admitted to Ward 10 overnight and arranged for a blood test to be carried out.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>9. Dr. Orr also requested that Kirsty be examined by a surgeon and he also arranged for an X- ray examination to be carried out although he subsequently cancelled this. Mr. McNally was the on-call Senior House Officer for Surgical Patients and he examined Kirsty in the Accident and Emergency Department at about </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>. He took into account the notes made by Dr. Orr and took a history of her symptoms from Kirsty herself. Mr. McNally recorded that Kirsty informed him that she had had 36 hours of vomiting and vague intermittent abdominal pain. The pain had no exacerbating or redeeming factors. She had had no previous pain like this. She had no systemic upset or fever or flu-like symptoms. He had enquired about her bowel habits and she told him that her bowels had opened normally the previous day, and that she had passed no diarrhoea, no blood and no mucus per rectum. She had had no recent upper respiratory tract infection and she had not been in contact with anyone who had been vomiting. She had her first period one month previously and had experienced only mild discomfort at that time.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>10. On examination of Kirsty Mr. McNally noted that Kirsty appeared slightly flushed. Both her pulse and blood pressure were within normal limits. He recorded her pulse at 90. He made a systematic examination of her abdomen. He found her abdomen to be soft with some mild tenderness in the centre. There was no rebound or guarding. There was no swelling or distension of the abdomen. He could detect no abdominal masses or enlargement of any abdominal organ. Her bowel sounds were normal. There were no scars on the abdomen to suggest previous surgery, nor did he detect any hernia. He found nothing to indicate an intestinal obstruction. He concluded that she was probably suffering from viral gastroenteritis although early appendicitis was possible. He arranged to review her the next day. In the meantime, after discussion with Dr. Orr it was agreed that Kirsty should be admitted to Ward 10 under Medical Care.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>11. Kirsty was received into Ward 10 at 01.00 0n Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> March. Ward 10 is an acute medical receiving ward for women and girls aged 13 or over. On admission to the ward her pulse was 129. Her blood pressure and temperature were within normal limits. The treatment plan proposed for Kirsty at that time included, <u>inter alia</u> four hourly observations of her blood pressure, pulse and temperature together with fasting and four hourly intravenous fluids. Kirsty vomited a further three times in the course of the night and early morning at 01.30, 03.30 and 6.30 producing coffee-ground vomit and blood.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>12. The consultant physician in charge of Ward 10 was Dr. McIntyre but the overall consultant physician covering that </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
 line-height:150%'>Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> March 2001</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> was Dr. Vernon. Between 08.00 and 09.00 hours that morning, Dr. Vernon carried out his post-receiving ward round to examine <u>inter alia </u>acute patients such as Kirsty who had been received into Ward 10 within the previous 24 hours. Dr. Vernon examined Kirsty when she was in a three-bedded side room of Ward 13. He was aware of her history of having been ill for a few days with intermittent vomiting for some 36-48 hours. She had been complaining of abdominal pains and had vomited some blood which was the immediate cause of her admission to hospital.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>13. Dr. Vernon spoke briefly with Kirsty and got the impression that she felt she was settling. Her tummy pain was not as bad, and for the time being she had stopped being sick. Her temperature was not raised. He examined her abdomen and found it to be soft and non-tender. He noted that she still felt sick but was no longer actively vomiting. He recommended that Kirsty be commenced upon bland fluids to be taken by mouth as a safe thing for her to take and as a simple trial in order to ascertain whether or not she was able to eat and drink. Dr. Vernon recommended that Kirsty should probably be kept in hospital until the Sunday.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>14. Later the same morning, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> March 2001</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>, at the conclusion of the surgical ward round, Mr McNally discussed Kirsty's case with Mr Gray his consultant surgeon then on duty. Mr McNally informed Mr Gray of the details of Kirsty's case. Mr McNally explained to Mr Gray that he considered Kirsty to be an unlikely case for appendicitis but more likely a case of gastroenteritis that had caused the vomiting. Mr Gray agreed that Kirsty should be reviewed again by Mr McNally and if there was a change in her condition then Mr Gray should be notified. Mr McNally then examined Kirsty at about </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
 line-height:150%'>11.00am</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'> the same morning on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> March 2001</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>. Mr McNally noted that Kirsty still had lost her appetite and was still complaining of some nausea. Her temperature was normal and the blood test results showed that her white cell count was normal. He examined her abdomen as he had done before and found it to be soft with some central abdominal tenderness. This he had noted as being previously present. In particular he noted there was no tenderness in the area of the right iliac fossa, which would have indicated appendicitis. His impression remained that Kirsty probably had a viral illness, which had produced the vomiting. Repeated vomiting would then have produced irritation of the lower end of her gullet or her stomach, which would in turn have caused some bleeding, and production of her coffee-ground vomit.

She was prescribed short acting anti-sickness medication 'Maxalon' to help her settle. She was examined on Sunday morning by Dr Morris who was the on-call Senior House Officer. Dr Morris noted that there had been two episodes of coffee-ground vomiting overnight. She noted also that Kirsty's blood pressure and pulse rate, however, had been normal. Kirsty was complaining of intermittent upper abdominal pain but that she had not had any diarrhoea. Dr Morris examined Kirsty's abdomen and found it to be soft with some tenderness at the upper abdomen but there was no evidence of rebound. Dr Morris also noted Kirsty's temperature as marginally raised at 37.3C and that Kirsty felt hot. There was a rash over the stomach and arms, which was pale, pink and non-blanching. Kirsty's pulse rate was raised at 120 per minute. Dr Morris arranged for intravenous fluids to be recommenced and sought a surgical review of Kirsty's case. Dr Morris further requested that an endoscopy be carried out the next day and changed the anti-emetic prescription from Maxalon to Stemetel.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>17. Following her examination of Kirsty on the morning of Sunday 11<sup>th</sup> March 2001, Dr Morris consulted Mr McNally the same morning and requested his opinion generally on Kirsty's case and more particularly as to whether the endoscopy should be carried out that day as an emergency, or whether it could safely be done in the normal course on the Monday morning. Mr McNally examined Kirsty and noted the observations made by Dr Morris. Kirsty could not remember vomiting during the night. Mr McNally noted that the abdominal pain was the same as it had been on the previous day. She had experienced some difficulty passing urine. Kirsty appeared flushed. Her temperature was 37.3C. He found the rash was as described by Dr Morris. He examined her abdomen and found that it was soft. There was tenderness in the upper and lower abdomen. He could detect no rebound or guarding. Her bowel sounds were active and normal. There was no distension of the abdomen. He concluded that the endoscopy could be carried out in the normal course of the following day and that the urine should be tested in case she had a urinary infection.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>18.

On her return from the operating theatre, Kirsty was examined by Dr McMahon who was the Senior House Officer on duty that week on Ward 10. Kirsty's mother was present and Kirsty was quite sedated. Dr McMahon took note of Miss Reid's report of the endoscopy findings that Kirsty had Grade 4 oesophagitis, and recommended that Kirsty be started on proton pump inhibitor tablets to reduce acid production in the stomach. Dr McMahon considered the endoscopy findings were unusual in a girl of Kirsty's age and requested that Kirsty be referred for the opinion of a consultant gastroenterologist.

He did not make an abdominal examination. Kirsty did complain of a vague abdominal pain or discomfort that she herself attributed to her menstruation. He was content to accept her explanation as a possible cause. Dr. Forrest understood that he was simply being asked, as a specialist, for his advice upon the treatment of Grade 4 oesophagitis. He noted the terms of the endoscopy report, which showed that the endoscopist considered that Kirsty suffered from oesophagitis of Grade 4 severity although no tear was seen. Dr Forrest was aware that Grade 4 is a grading specific to reflux oesophagitis and that reflux oesophagitis is the most common form of oesophagitis. He was slightly concerned that reflux oesophagitis did not fit entirely with the symptoms Kirsty had been describing. Reflux oesophagitis is an unusual condition to find in a 13-year-old child. It is generally a condition that affects adults. There was no history of heartburn or the regurgitation of foodstuffs that are the classical symptoms of reflux oesophagitis. Dr Forrest noted an initial differential diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis and noted also that other causes should be considered. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>24. The other possible causes of Kirsty's oesophagitis noted by Dr Forrest were two viral conditions, namely, herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus. Those viruses can, quite rarely, cause lasting infection of the gullet. Dr Forrest noted that there was no history in Kirsty's case of any preceding flu-like illness, which might be expected with a viral infection. In order to test for a viral infection, Dr Forrest proposed that serological tests be carried out to look for evidence of the body responding to those infections and to see if there were any antibodies present. He wished also to repeat the endoscopy in order to obtain a biopsy of any particular ulceration present. He discussed this with Kirsty and her mother at the time. Kirsty indicated that she had found the endoscopy procedure traumatic and did not wish an immediate repeat.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>25. Dr Forrest did not consider that a further endoscopy was an urgent matter. To take a biopsy and obtain the results of the tests could take several weeks. On balance Dr Forrest was satisfied that it was reasonable to treat the oesophagitis empirically on the basis of the information available that she had Grade 4 reflux oesophagitis and to observe how her condition responded to that treatment. He confirmed the treatment prescribed by Dr McMahon, namely, Lansoprazole medication, in the form of Losec tablets, to suppress acid production. That could be expected to produce a systematic improvement within 24-36 hours.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>26.

The post-mortem examination revealed that Kirsty had a very rare congenital abnormality. There was a 5cm diverticulum, a pouch-like sac, protruding from the wall of the ileum, or small intestine, about three feet from the ileocaecal valve. From the apex of the diverticulum there was a 3cm fibrous band or cord extending back onto the mesenteric surface. This formed a gap or window of about 2.5cm in diameter between the fibrous band the wall of the diverticulum. A loop of the small intestine below the diverticulum and fibrous band had extended into the gap so formed and had become trapped and constricted. A sketch illustration was drawn by Dr. Howatson in the course of his evidence on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>25<sup>th</sup> November 2002</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> and is attached hereto as Appendix I.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>55. This trapped loop of the small intestine constituted an internal hernia and formed an obstruction of the small intestine. This had caused the bowel to become dilated and distended.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>56. The fibrous band or cord constricted and pressed each end of the herniated loop of bowel against the wall of the diverticulum. The loop of bowel that was constricted became engorged with blood as the arterial blood supply pushed in and the venous return blood at lower pressure could not get back out. This engorgement increased the pressure of the constriction. This pressure also restricted the blood flow to the wall of the diverticulum. The restriction of blood flow to the wall of the diverticulum caused the internal or mucosal surface of the diverticulum to necrotise and break down. This allowed bacteria from inside the bowel to invade further into the wall of the diverticulum causing it to become inflamed and infected. This inflammation and infection had progressed deeper and deeper into the wall of the diverticulum from the inside of the diverticulum outwards. This caused first the death of the cells in the mucosal wall, then the sub-mucosa, then the muscle and, finally, this perforation of the wall of the diverticulum went all the way through, and the contents of the bowel spilled out into the peritoneal cavity.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>57. The diaphragm of the abdomen was found to be intact, but pushed upwards as a result of distension of the gastrointestinal tract. The peritoneal cavity contained 1420mls of foul-smelling brown liquid, which was intestinal content. Most of the fluid was in the pelvis but it also tracked up both parabolic gutters to the level of the diaphragm. The peritoneal surface of the visceral and parietal peritoneum was dusky and not shiny.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>58. The findings at the post-mortem indicated that perforation had occurred about 4-6 hours prior to the time of death. The escape of gas and fluid from the bowel by means of the perforation caused a diffused peritonitis. Polymorph cells were found to have left the bloodstream and entered into the tissues. This process generally begins to take place in about 4-6 hours following an acute inflammation, and in this case the process had just begun. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>59. There was also a localised peritonitis with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate on the serosal surface of the intestine adjacent to the diverticulum. The localised peritonitis relating to the pathology of the diverticulum had been continuing for a greater length of time than the diffuse peritonitis. The process of necrosis leading to perforation of the diverticulum would have taken from 24-72 hours to reach the stage of perforation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>60. The vitreous fluid in the eye showed a relatively normal biochemical reading.

The quantity of fluid found in the abdomen, and the distension of the intestine above the diverticulum, indicate that there was complete and intermittent obstruction, or an incomplete obstruction, present for 2-3 days prior to death.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>62. The post-mortem examination revealed that Kirsty had not been suffering from gastritis, colitis, or viral gastroenteritis before her death. There was nothing found to cause a rise in C-reactive Protein (CRP) before death beyond the pathology described in the post-mortem report.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>63. The cause of Kirsty's intestinal obstruction was readily amenable to surgical treatment. By carrying out a laparotomy and then cutting the fibrous band the hernia would have resolved and Kirsty would have survived.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>64. A number of circumstances made the diagnosis of Kirsty's bowel obstruction initially difficult. There were no predisposing factors present in her case. She was not elderly. She did not suffer from cancer and there was no risk of internal adhesions from previous operations. The form of obstruction was itself very rare. Meckels' diverticulum occurs in about 2% of the population. A much smaller proportion still present with a diverticulum which is offset in relation to the mesentery let alone connected to it by a fibrous band. The presentation of this obstruction was not initially clinically obvious. The obstruction was intermittent at first. The bowel sounds were normal. The classical signs of distension and rigidity of the abdomen were not present until about six hours before death. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>65. The symptoms with which Kirsty presented were readily explained by causes, which masked the true underlying condition of an obstructed bowel. The haematemesis was explicable by the bleeding being caused by Grade 4 oesophagitis. Kirsty's complaints of abdominal pain were readily accounted for by the violent retching associated with vomiting, or by pain or discomfort attributed to her current menstruation.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>66.

Equally, as the evidence progressed, it became clear that there was no difficulty in securing consultant support or advice.

The evidence made clear, however, that admission to hospital with bowel obstruction is a relatively common phenomenon. A busy surgical ward may expect to see at least two such cases per week. The central questions at the Inquiry were, firstly, whether Kirsty had been discharged from hospital prematurely on </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;
 line-height:150%'>Wednesday 14<sup>th</sup> March 2001</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>.

In his report and in his evidence he described the two forms of pathological inflammation that he found post mortem. Firstly, there was the localised area of necrosis and inflammation where the perforation in the diverticulum occurred. This was a progressive necrotising inflammatory process developing over a period of 24-72 hours. This, I accept, accounts for the moderated rise in CRP of 56 recorded in the blood biochemistry report of </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>13<sup>th</sup> March 2004</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>.

Given the timetable for the pathology he described and the fact that no other source of inflammation was found post-mortem, I considered that possibility to be highly improbable. The same considerations apply to the elevated pulse rate. In accepting the evidence of Dr Howatson as to the timing of the development of the pathology I reject the evidence of Mr Nixon. I recognised that he was a most experienced and thoughtful skilled witness, but I preferred the evidence of Dr Howatson. It was he who had carried out the post-mortem examination, and I considered that he was best placed to judge the extent to which the polymorph cells had left the bloodstream and entered the tissues. It follows from this that there was no question of the hospital, or indeed, Dr </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Ireland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>, failing to detect a diffused peritonitis in an acute abdomen.

Dr Howatson considered that this had been gradually building up over about two days. He confirmed that there were distended loops of bowel found. Had Kirsty been in hospital care instead of at home during her last few traumatic hours of her life. It is likely that in a hospital environment, her condition would have been noticed and her life might have been saved. In reaching this view I had in mind the evidence of Mr Nixon to the effect that the majority of patients who present with a perforated bowel are saved if they reach hospital within 6-12 hours of the perforation occurring.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>The further question that arises out of the timing of the pathology is whether, without looking for signs of an acute abdomen, there were, nonetheless, symptoms or indicators apparent during her period in hospital that might have led to the diagnosis of Kirsty's underlying condition while it was still in its sub-acute form, and which should have prevented her discharge from hospital.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Two indicators stood out as alarm signals.

All that can be said with confidence is that it was probably somewhere in Ward 10. Dr McMahon had no recollection of seeing it or having it brought to her attention and it has now gone missing. Not surprisingly at the conclusion of the Inquiry I was invited to find that the absence of this report constituted a defect in the system of working that contributed to the death of Kirsty in terms of Section 6(1) (d) of the Act. However, without knowing where the document was at the time of the ward round, I cannot be satisfied that the system failed on this occasion, far less that the failure was generalised and systemic.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>The third matter that was canvassed in evidence in relation to Kirsty's discharge from hospital concerned her clinical presentation and whether she appeared to be improving.

Her food and fluid intake orally was much harder to assess. No detailed observations or records of her oral intake of food were kept. The records of her fluid intake kept upon the Fluid and Electrolyte balance chart and the Fluid and Additive Medicine chart, Nos. 6/54 and 6/56 respectively, stop recording upon Sunday 11<sup>th</sup> March 2001 and yet she was still receiving intravenous fluids up until at least lunchtime on Tuesday 13<sup>th</sup> March 2001 when she was briefly reviewed by Dr. Forrest. That was the principal reason that caused Dr. Forrest to overrule Dr. McMahon's first decision to discharge because Kirsty still had intravenous fluids running at that time. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Her oral input of food is equally hard to assess beyond saying that it was not very much at all.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>There were no observations or records of her bowel movements kept or observations of bowel sounds after Mr McNally's third examination of Kirsty upon </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Sunday 11<sup>th</sup> March 2001</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> when he recorded the bowel sounds as active. The extent to which her bowel was functioning is hard to assess upon the available evidence. Her clinical presentation did not cause concern to Dr. McMahon or to the nursing staff and Dr. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Ireland</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'> had no particular concerns although he was not in a position to consider the question of improvement. As at the date of discharge Dr. McMahon felt that Kirsty was improving. Her parents were concerned to get her home because they felt that that she was not improving in the hospital setting. Mr. Thompson's evidence was that Kirsty's condition was just about the same all along. I was inclined to prefer the evidence of a Mr Thompson who, I considered was more likely to be familiar with Kirsty's demeanour. I conclude that her presentation and demeanour was a neutral indicator as to her improvement and fitness for discharge.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>The one critical matter that was available for consideration, and which was left out of account, was the record of the elevated and steadily rising pulse. Had it been noted and checked at the time of the ward round I am satisfied that it was likely to have been confirmed. From this other investigations would have followed. These might not have led immediately to a diagnosis of obstruction, but I consider it likely that Kirsty would have remained in hospital while investigations to explain the tachycardia continued. I cannot determine what precise form the investigations would or should have taken; whether by consulting the missing CRP report, whether by further CRP tests, or tests by ultra sound or X-ray; or at what precise stage a consultant or consultant surgeon would have been involved. I am satisfied, however, that as the underlying pathology developed there was a very lively possibility that her condition would have been identified and her life might have been saved. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
